    <richText>&lt;b&gt;A late season storm was heading towards Colorado...WP was supposed to get more than a foot.  I took off thursday night after Max&#x2019;s play, and hit WP.  CRAZY drive...not many folks on the road, but I had to clear ice off the wipers multiple times.&#xD;&#xD;Friday brought 10&#x201D; before the lifts opened, and then another 6&#x201D; during the day.  It got VERY windy after lunch...I barely made it back to the C-lot as all the lifts were shutting down.&#xD;&#xD;Saturday was glorious...awesome laps through Belle.  The blues over at Vasquez still had 1+ feet of powder...and cruising through Buckaroo trees was awesome. &lt;/b&gt;</richText>
