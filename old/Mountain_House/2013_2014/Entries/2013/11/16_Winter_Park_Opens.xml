    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Mom had a race in Vegas, so Max and I headed up to the mountain house.  WP had opened on wednesday with parkway and porcupine...Max and I decided to check the snow report first thing in the morning to decide where to go.&#xD;&#xD;Loveland has Drifter and Firecut under chair 2...they got 2&#x201D; of snow.&#xD;Copper opened up the flyer on friday...they had 5&#x201D; of new snow.&#xD;Bad news for both:  cold and windy, so we decided to just hit the local mountain.  Not the most challenging terrain, but at least we had fun...and I spotted these two:&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
