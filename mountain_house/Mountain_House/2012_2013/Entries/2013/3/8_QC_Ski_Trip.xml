    <richText>&lt;b&gt;This year&#x2019;s ski trip was to WP.  I decided to forgo the bus, and drive up separately.  Chris and Ken both wanted to see some of my favorite trees...so I mostly played tour guide all day.  Did laps through upper switchyard and Belle to start off, then played a little under Eagle Wind.  At lunch, Ken, Richard and I decided to hike the cirque...ended up getting a snowmobile ride most of the way there (yay!  Gotta do that more often...)&#xD;&#xD;After lunch was Pine Cliffs, Weather Station, and Runaway...but that side&#x2019;s snow wasn&#x2019;t as good as the north facing stuff up top.  Still, good day...vid below.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
