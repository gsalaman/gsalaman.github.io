    <richText>&lt;b&gt;For the second year in a row, we avoided the crowds at WP and spent the weekend up in the Goldminer&#x2019;s Daughter up in Alta.  This year, the snow wasn&#x2019;t as good, but still got 3 days of good skiing in.  They had more of the Greeley area open...Gunter, Max and I explored over there.  Alta is much more about steeps, and not so much about bumps....I&#x2019;m glad that I had that lesson with Tom that showed me how to get over my edges!&#xD;&#xD;One highlight:  I saw Chuck Mumford (from GNAR), and gave him the pro call-out! &#xD;&#xD;Vid below...&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
