    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Dropped Max off at class, and did some laps through Belle.  Even better back there this week...soooooo much better than last season.  Vid below.&#xD;&#xD;In the afternoon, the freestyle devo program had a &#x201C;ski with the coach&#x201D; event...parents were invited to come ski with the class to see what kinds of things they were working on.  Alli dressed up as Jane...Dave was *way* impressed.  Started off with the Do-or-die trees, had them huck some smaller cliffs, and did Eagle and then Balsh.  VERY cool to see what they do (although Alli said she could have done without seeing them huck...) a really fun day!!!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
