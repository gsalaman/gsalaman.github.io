    <description>October was one of the warmest months on record....although A-Basin opened in October, Loveland wasn&#x2019;t able to get going until the beginning of November.  Took advantage of it by doing a bunch of mountain biking instead.  Copper, Breck, and Winter Park all pushed out their openings.  Then an arctic front came through mid November....went from 60s to single digits...and a little decent snow to help out the resorts.  Dry for the beginning of December (more biking!)  Snowy over the first part of the break, and then generally dry for January.  Here are the numbers thus far:</description>

      <description>A late season storm was heading towards Colorado...WP was supposed to get more than a foot.  I took off thursday night after Max&#x2019;s play, and hit WP.  CRAZY drive...not many folks on the road, but I had to clear ice off the wipers multiple times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friday brought 10&#x201D; before the lifts opened, and then another 6&#x201D; during the day.  It got VERY windy after lunch...I barely made it back to the C-lot as all the lifts were shutting down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saturday was glorious...awesome laps through Belle.  The blues over at Vasquez still had 1+ feet of powder...and cruising through Buckaroo trees was awesome. </description>

      <description>With 8&#x201D; snow monday night, 6&#x201D; tuesday night, and then another 4&#x201D; wednesday, we got enough coverage to open up a bunch more terrain.  Gunter and I started on Belle, and when the Cirque opened, we headed there!  No sled (LAME!!!), but we ended up doing the hike twice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First lap was down Playing Field to the South Basin...only one set of tracks in front of us there.  </description>

      <description>It&#x2019;s been dry since the break...not a lot of snow to speak of.  Then, this week, WP got 6&#x201D; on Monday night, 5&#x201D; Tuesday night, and another 3&#x201D; Wednesday night.  I went up solo Thursday night for a day of skiing Friday, searching for leftovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Started over at Eagle.  Not too bad...the Thunderbird trees were much better than Medicine Man &amp;amp; Black Coal.  You could squeeze over to Left Hand...pretty good in there too; but I needed a water break.   Headed down the switchyard trees (REALLY good in there), and decided to do a Pano lap on the off chance they&#x2019;d opened Belle...and they did!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great tracks in there...vid and graphs below.</description>

      <description>Gunter and I started off the new year with a ski trip out to Chicago Ridge at Ski Cooper.  One snowcat holds 12 (we had 10 guests), and they say they average 8-10 powder runs a day.  (We got 10)  The first one was a little wind-blown, but after that, we found areas with powdery goodness for the rest of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They do beacons and powder rentals for everyone (I just used the S7s, and Gunter switched from the rental alpines to his tele Keepers early on).  They also provide lunch...cooked mountainside in a yurt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No phresheez tracking for the day (no cell service, and phones may interfere with the beacons)...but did do helmet-cam:</description>

      <description>WP got about 9&#x201D; after the couple from yesterday, so Alli and I headed out early.  Windy...they had Pioneer and Pano shut down.  Got really crowded really quickly, but we had some great morning runs before bailing.  Video below: </description>

      <description>Between Thanksgiving and Sunday, we didn&#x2019;t get any flakes.  Saturday was day 2 of Devo Travel Team for Max with Coach Scott...Alli stayed home, and I went and worked on my moguls.  They had C-lift and Sunnyside open...under C-lift was sketchy (Sleeper, Little Ten, Freeriders, and Phantom).  Same for Sunnyside (Bluebell, Roundhouse, and Edelweiss).  Got some good work in though...charts below.  Oh, and the perfect wax test:  see if you can make it from Super Gauge, down past Olympia and uphill to the top of Cheshire/Jabber without skating.</description>

      <description>4&#x201D; snow monday, 2&#x201D; tuesday, and 8&#x201D; wednesday means that WP could finally open the top.  Headed out Wednesday...they had Cranmer, all the Olympia stuff, and Bash and Balsh open.  Still a little sketchy at the bottom of Balsh, but hey, real moguls in November?  Woo hoo!  And got this cool shot of Max jumping into Cheshire:</description>

      <description>Max has Thanksgiving week off; with snow in the forecast, we headed up to the hills on Saturday.  Sunday was a WP day...they got 7&#x201D; of new snow, but still only had Sale and the Discovery Park stuff open.  Copper, on the other hand, has the Blacks under Excellerator, and just opened the Timberline lift...so while Max and Mom decided to stay home, I day-tripped it from Fraser on Monday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drive was evil both ways...2:15...with a slick pass and treacherous tunnel.  It was *totally* worth it though...they just opened up &#x201C;The Moz&#x201D;, and got some fresh pow!  Spent the late morning doing runs under the Timberline, then headed to the Excellerator to work on my bumps.  Ahhhh!!!!</description>

      <description>Alli brought out the dress for WP opening...you can barely make out her, me, and Max with all the snow coming down!!!  Alas, only Parkway, Porcupine, and Bobcat for opening day, but they were working on Sale.  Checking around, Loveland is still just Chair 1, but Copper planned on opening the Flyer today, with directed skiing down CDL and Mine Dump.  </description>

      <description>With Winter Park pushing out their opening from the 12th to the 15th, Alli decided to hit Loveland on Wednesday with Danica....and they let me tag along!  Although the temp was very cold, it didn&#x2019;t feel too bad...and they had a bunch of snow, so it wasn&#x2019;t icy.  Had Spillway and Richards open, but no Chair 2 or 6 yet.  Still, was an awesome first day!!!</description>
