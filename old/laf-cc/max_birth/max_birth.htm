<h1>Maxwell James Salaman</h1>
<p>Max was born at 8:10pm on Tuesday, April 29th.&nbsp; He weighed 7 lbs 14 ozs
and was 20 inches long.</p>
<p>He took a while to introduce himself, but after 15 hours of labor, and lots
of good drugs, he finally decided to show up.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here's Mom and Dad after the arrival.&nbsp; Yeah, they look pretty tired...</p>

<p>Picture from 5/3.&nbsp; Check out the big &quot;V&quot; mark on his
forehead...a testament to all the work he had to go through to be born.&nbsp;
He's also a little confused here...why doesn't daddy's finger give me any
milk?!?</p>
