    <richText>After presents, Gunter and I headed over to do some &#x201C;lighter&#x201D; skiing.  Did a bunch of the easier trees, and *had* to do some bumps.  My favorite part of the day:  cruising over at pioneer.  Gunter was working on Tele drills, so we tried a &#x201C;2-lap/3-lap&#x201D; interleaving.  I tried to &#x201C;gain&#x201D; as many chairs as I could...typically for those speed runs, it was around 30+ chairs.  Looking at Phresheez, my speeds were in the 35-40 mph range.  Note in the vid below, this is &#x201C;real time&#x201D;...no speeding up.  Fun! </richText>
