    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Jane opened on Friday...Max and I headed up on Saturday for ATP Devo.  They had Gandy and Frenchman open Friday, but looking up those trails today, I can see why they were closed today!  They did have the bottoms of Spike and Sterling open...but those were evil.  &#xD;&#xD;Looks like they&#x2019;re prepping Cheshire Cat and Sidetrack/Sleeper...hoping that those will open when Gunter is out.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
