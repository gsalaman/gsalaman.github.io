<h1>December at Winter Park</h1>
<p>The scouting report for Bob, Vanessa and Simon.</p>
<hr>

<p>The Cheshire Cat/Jabberwocky split.&nbsp; Note we've got some powder.</p>
<hr>

<p>Looking down Jabberwocky.&nbsp; Yes, this is a blue, but it's ungroomed, and 
has some nice, soft baby-bumps on it.&nbsp; You can see Fraser Valley stretching 
out in the distance, and see the snowmaking on Twideele Dee.</p>
<hr>

<p>A closer view down the slope...from those soft bumps.&nbsp; You can see one 
of the turnouts to White Rabbit.</p>

<p>Riding up the Olympia lift, over White Rabbit (a groomed blue).&nbsp; That 
cutoff we were looking at is over there on the right side.</p>

<p>Change of venue...this is the top of the Mary Jane mountain, right below the 
top of the sunnyside lift looking southwest at the top of Parsen's Bowl.&nbsp;
</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="IMGP0953.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Looking due west at Parsen's Bowl from the same spot.&nbsp; There's a road 
that goes along the top there (very windy!) that lets you drop into the bowl 
wherever you want.</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="IMGP0956.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>My first ride up the Panoramic Express.&nbsp; Lots of good powder in the 
trees today!&nbsp; </p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="IMGP0957.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Looking straight up the lift...</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="IMGP0959.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>The view from the top.&nbsp; Very windy today, and a fair amount of 
wind-swept powder.&nbsp; Parry's Peak is in the background, trying to peek out 
of a cloud.&nbsp; </p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="IMGP0960.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Here's the new trail on that ridge (Parry's Peak Trail), looking up at the 
top of the ridge on the top-left.&nbsp; You can drop down into the trees on the 
right, or follow this thin groomed track back down to the lift.</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="IMGP0961.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Going back up the Sunnyside lift, looking west at the Bluebell trail (groomed 
blue).</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="IMGP0962.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Looking right at the bottom (Blue-Black bumpy portion) of Roundhouse.</p>
