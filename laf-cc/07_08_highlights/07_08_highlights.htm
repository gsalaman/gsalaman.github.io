<h1>2007-2008 Winter Park Highlights</h1>
<p>With the new Mountain House, we spent almost every weekend up in Winter Park 
(and then some).&nbsp; Here are some snapshots from throughout the season.</p>
<hr>
<p>Christmas and New Year's has been a tradition of going up to the hills with 
Rod, Michelle, Amy, Ken, and the ever-persistent Gunter.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="top_view.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>My favorite place at the time:&nbsp; the top of Parsen's Bowl.</p>
<p>(ed note:&nbsp; the new favorite is under the Eagle Wind Lift.&nbsp; No 
pictures in this set from there...I spent too much time skiing and not enough 
time snapping pictures, which I believe was the right choice.&nbsp; Note that 
one other memorable momemt was when I was on the lift with Alli and Gunter, the 
lift stops, and I get a call from work.&nbsp; &quot;Okay, I've got some time&quot; he 
thinks, and so he does some feature planning and explanations from the backside 
of Winter Park)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_top.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Another view from the top, looking up this time, at a crazy German.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunters_lunch.jpg" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>So Gunter LOVES to pack his lunch.&nbsp; He usually hides in under a tree.&nbsp; 
However, when you need to meet the rest of your party down a the bottom, how do 
you carry it?&nbsp; No, he's not pregnant...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_amy_ken_ny.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>After a day of hard skiing, this is where the kids usually end up.</p>
<p>So the other thing about Gunter: he's always trying to getcha down scary 
stuff.&nbsp; Like this cliff, seen from the top:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="tressel.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>&quot;Come on, Glenn, You'll love it!!!&quot;&nbsp; Yes, he does always manage to talk 
me down it...</p>

<p>But it's rewarding!&nbsp; My first Trestle Run, January 4, 2008.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another fun trip.&nbsp; Simon, Catherine, Bob, and Vanessa come up for a week 
in late January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note the number of foosballs in the playing field. </p>
<hr>
<p>Max digs the Nastar course.&nbsp; He HATES being passed.&nbsp; This pic is 
from the end of February...a far cry from where he was early season!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="max_cheshire.jpg" width="640" height="853"></p>
<p>My personal favorite...closing day, with Alli, Max, and Gunter.&nbsp; This is 
from Cheshire Cat, usually a groomed Blue-Black.&nbsp; Today, it's got 
mini-moguls on it.&nbsp; No problem for max, as long as he has a path to follow.</p>
