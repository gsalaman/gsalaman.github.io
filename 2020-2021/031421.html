			<h2>Delayed Snowpocalypse</h2>
			<h3 style="color:red">Sunday, March 14, 2021</h3>
			<p>Lots of mumblings about this upcoming snowstorm...was supposed to start Friday, and go through Monday with multiple FEET possible.  I got Alli's car back from the dealer (story for another day) Thursday, and headed up.  My plan was to ski Friday, take Saturday off, then ski sunday...but I didn't have Sunday reservations, so I'd hope they opened up; if not, head back sunday early.  Ideally, I'd stay and ski monday too, but I previously committed to doing winterim.  Oh well...not a biggie.</p>
		    <p>Friday was a typical bluebird day...even spring conditions.  Took out the phantoms, did some bumps, felt out of shape, but hey, nice to be on the mountain.</p>
		    <p>Wake up in the middle of the night, look outside, and hey, stars!  Didn't expect that or I would have brought up the eq mount...</p>
		    <p>No snow saturday morning.  Opensnow says "just wait, it'll come saturday afternoon."  It didn't.</p>
		    <p>Keep trying the sunday reservations anyways...and I'm getting nervous about it.  Wake up in the middle of the night, and poof!  Grabbed 'em for sunday!  Got some snow thus far, but nothing jaw-dropping.</p>
		    <p>Get up at (what I thought was) my normal time to check WP's webcam.  Yup...10" and counting!  Let's go!  Oh, but why does my Mac say it's 7:15 rather than 6:15?  Crap.  Daylight savings.  Expecting the huge crowds, I do the vintage thing...running a little later than I'd like, but I was on the mountain by 9.  Headed straight to pioneer to the new favorite stash...got two laps in there before the lift broke down.  Pic below...thigh-high pow. </p>
		  
		    <p>Figured if I was gonna wait, I may as well head towards belle.  Took hilo to pano, spent 15 minutes in line (corral boundary), and got an *EPIC* lap through Belle!!!</p>
		  
		    <p>Paid for it though...the line at eagle was all the way up the egress...about half way from thunderbird to sharpnose!!!  After already being down at Pioneer, I decided to stick it out.  Everyone was cool, but took 25 min to get on the lift.</p>
		  
		    <p>More switchyard trees, another Belle lap, and I head over to Harold's and the Weather Station trees.  Ride up the C-lift, and I get a text that Dawson is cancelled tomorrow!!!  It's funny, being retired means I'm more often on my own schedule than not, but getting the bonus snow day really feels good!  Checking the roads, yeah, I wouldn't be going back tonight anyways.  Now I just need to hope for getting those reservations for monday...</p>
