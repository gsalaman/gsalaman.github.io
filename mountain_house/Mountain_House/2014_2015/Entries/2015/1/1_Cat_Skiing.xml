    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Gunter and I started off the new year with a ski trip out to Chicago Ridge at Ski Cooper.  One snowcat holds 12 (we had 10 guests), and they say they average 8-10 powder runs a day.  (We got 10)  The first one was a little wind-blown, but after that, we found areas with powdery goodness for the rest of the day.&#xD;&#xD;They do beacons and powder rentals for everyone (I just used the S7s, and Gunter switched from the rental alpines to his tele Keepers early on).  They also provide lunch...cooked mountainside in a yurt.&#xD;&#xD;No phresheez tracking for the day (no cell service, and phones may interfere with the beacons)...but did do helmet-cam:&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
