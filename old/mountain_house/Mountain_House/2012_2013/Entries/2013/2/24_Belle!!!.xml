    <richText>&lt;b&gt;While we were up at Alta, WP finally opened Belle, and had the Cirque open for directed Skiing.  Max had comp#2 on saturday, but he and mom went back that night...so I had a full day of &#x201C;wear Glenn out&#x201D;.  :)&#xD;&#xD;They were supposed to get dumped on, but turns out they only got a couple inches.  Still, the trees were pretty good.  Belle was rocky up at the top, and the powder chute was a minefield (yes, had to fix one core shot...)  The trees were great though...could find stashes of deep pow.&#xD;&#xD;They also opened up the far-side of the cliff on Black Coal, giving access to Left Hand.  Good stuff in there.  No vids, but graphs below:&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
