			<p>This was the Season of Covid.  Winter Park put a bunch of "distancing rules", which helped them stay open.  Most indoor spaces were closed except for the biggies...and those had strict occupancy limits.  This meant food was "grab-n-go", with you highly encouraged to bring your own and eat either outside or at your car.  The lines themselves were re-formulated to allow for decent spacing, and they enforced "must wear a mask in line, and getting on and off the lifts."</p>
			<p>In the period before the season, Grand County experienced record fires...the Williams Fork was concerning, but kept under control, whilst the East Troublesome fire ravaged through both Grand Lake and RMNP.  WP helped house both the firefighters and displaced residents.  That, coupled with a low snow start, meant they didn't open until December.</p>
			<p>They started off differentely than the rest of the resorts...no reservations needed.  After a few weekends, they figured out this wasn't workable...and did ticket reservations.  Weekends, as expected, filled up right away...but fortunately for me, weekdays have stayed mostly empty.  And, it looks like you can get weekend days either day before or day of as people cancel.</p>
			<p>Here's the current chart of days for our crew...lower than year's past, but hey, we're still skiing...</p>
