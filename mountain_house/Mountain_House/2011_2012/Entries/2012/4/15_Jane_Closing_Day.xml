    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Jane had an end-of-season treat...6&#x201D; of fresh snow for closing day.  I had the summer storage wax on the S7s, so I scraped it off, and headed out.  Funny, this is the way the resort was *supposed* to look all year long.&#xD;&#xD;We went down for the party in the C-Lot...Alli dressed up as Jane, and Max made a robot costume.  Alli and Max wanted to hang out in the lot, so I ran up and got early tracks. Headed straight for Pano, but they had Animal Control up there to take care of some Moose!  (That lift never did open).  Did a bunch of trees instead...was the first one through the backside switchyard trees.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
