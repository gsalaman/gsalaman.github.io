    <richText>&lt;b&gt;We weren&#x2019;t expecting any new snow, but woke up to 4&#x201D;.  At that point, I had to run downstairs and prep the S7s.  :)&#xD;&#xD;Spent the morning with Alli...headed up to Pano.  Did a couple runs up there, but the snow was in a weird state, so we bailed fairly quickly.  Trestle was open, and was glorious!  Hadn&#x2019;t been tracked out, so the face was more similar to the headwalls than giant moguls with rocks.  Fun!  Did a run through the newly opened Boiler...good conditions there too.&#xD;&#xD;After lunch, headed over to Pioneer (good snow), and after Alli bailed, headed back to the Jane side for some more runs.  Good day!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
