<title>Hot Tub Install</title>
</head>

<h1>Hot Tub</h1>
<p>The first Mountain House &quot;accessory&quot; needed to be a Hot Tub.&nbsp; The back 
deck was already mostly set up for it...the previous owners had a tub out there, 
but it had issues, so they pulled it out rather than foisting it on the new 
owners (us).&nbsp; Everything was pretty much set to go...they had 220 run out 
there, with a separate GFCI breaker, so the only thing left to do was to 
coordinate a tub delivery.</p>
<p>Did a fair amount of browsing...you really want something energy efficient, 
but also comfy.&nbsp; Finally settled on a Wind River Spa...they're a Colorado 
company, and have pretty good reviews.&nbsp; After a visit to their showroom 
(Max dug climbing around in the empty tubs) and factory (Alli dug that part), we 
were sold.</p>
<p>The trick now was the install...since we were putting it on the back deck, we 
definitely needed to crane it in, as it wouldn't fit through the house.&nbsp; 
So, enter a 3-way coordination:&nbsp; the crane company (Fraser Crane), the 
electrician (Alex from BondCo electric up in Fraser), and the Wind River 
delivery folks.&nbsp; All was set for Nov 29th, 2007.</p>

<p>Here's the deck, prior to install.&nbsp; You can definite see where the old 
hot-tub was.</p>

<p>Max's favorite part was the crane...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="crane_over.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>...and hoisting the tub over the house.</p>

<p>A little maneuvering, some repositioning on the 220-line, and we had power.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Note that they don't use full-foam insulation.&nbsp; The California Companies 
(CalSpas, HotSprings, etc) tout full foam as the best way to keep temp up, but 
in reality, and air chamber works better than enclosing the whole thing in foam.&nbsp; 
Also, if you get a leak, you can access most of that PVC.&nbsp; The front 
insulation panels are off in this picture, but you get the idea of a small air 
cavity in between the front panel and the foam around the tub itself.</p>

<p>All wired up and ready to go!</p>

<p>Heating up...48 degrees to go!&nbsp; It climbed about 5 or 6 degrees an hour.&nbsp; 
You do the math.</p>

<p>And the most important part!&nbsp; Alli and Max got a kick out of soaking in 
the snow.&nbsp; No, the color on this pick isn't wrong...Alli really does have 
pink hair right now.&nbsp; </p>
