    <richText>Large crew descended on Winter Park...the full Stephens&#x2019;, QJ, Pei, and Sarah, and Didi, Uli, Lara, and Lucas.  Did some laps under Pano...got some fun footage there.  Gunter and I tried to convince Michelle to go do some bumps instead of doing lunch, but alas, to no avail.  &#xD;&#xD;We went and did some bump laps, but it was getting *really* warm.  My waxing skills can deal with about 50F, but past that, and things get sticky.  At that point, I wasn&#x2019;t really having fun anymore, so I headed back to the car...and realized that I had lost my loaner cell phone!  Bummer!  The good news is that someone found it and turned it in, so I didn&#x2019;t have to look like a major klutzoid to Greg.</richText>
