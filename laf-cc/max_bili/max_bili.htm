<title>Max's Episode With Jaundice</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>Max was a little jaundiced when we took him home.&nbsp; Apparently, Jaundice
is very common out here in Colorado, and is more prevalent with breast feeding
and traumatic births.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infants are born with a certain amount of red blood cells.&nbsp; These red
blood cells break down into Bilirubin, which in normal folks gets processed by
the liver.&nbsp; Bilirubin is also broken down by UV light.&nbsp; For infants,
the liver typically doesn't come on line for a few days, so there's nothing to
break down the Bilirubin.&nbsp; Too much red blood cell breakdown, and you get
too much Bilirubin, leading to the yellowish color.</p>
<p>There's a couple different ways of dealing with this.&nbsp; If the Jaundice
is mild, you can just leave your kid out in the sun.&nbsp; If it's more severe,
the Doc will prescribe some sort of UV treatment.&nbsp; Here's a picture of Max
in his little Bili-Bed:</p>

<p>The bed we got has the UV light (that blue tinge) coming from the bottom,
where he sleeps on a clear, padded mattress-type pad.&nbsp; It's covered by a
velcro-enclosed blanket, with holes for his head and arms.&nbsp; He didn't mind
this *TOO* much...I guess it's a similar feeling to being swaddled, so he did
okay in it.&nbsp; You're supposed to leave the patient in the bed all the time,
with the exception of feedings and changings.</p>

<p>Every morning, Max and Dad would take a trip to Avista to get a blood draw to
check the Bilirubin level.&nbsp; (which let Mom catch up on some rest and take a
shower)&nbsp; After a few days in the bed, Max's level got back to normal.&nbsp;
Woo hoo!</p>
