    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Gunter came in last night, and Max had class, so Alli, Gunter and I played around.  They just opened pioneer yesterday, so even though there hasn&#x2019;t been snow for a little while, I still brought out the S7s, as I figured the Buckaroo trees would be glorious.  I was right.  :)&#xD;&#xD;Alli brought out the downhills...I had forgotten how much faster she was on those.  Got some great shots of her turns in the vid below.&#xD;&#xD;We did meet up with Max for lunch.  He was very excited, as they got first tracks down Short Haul, and hucked some of the rocks.  Dangerous!!!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
