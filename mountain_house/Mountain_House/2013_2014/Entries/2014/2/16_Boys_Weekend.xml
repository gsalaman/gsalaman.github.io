    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Gunter came in Thursday night...we had a boys weekend whilst Alli was in Atlanta.  Max took a rest day on friday; Gunter and I did a bunch of laps through Eagle (left hand was pretty good).  Broke for lunch (Gunter needed to do a conf call); I took a tumble above switchyard and busted the break on my binding.  Skied tentatively after that...took it back home, and we figured out the screw had just popped off (whew!)&#xD;&#xD;Saturday was class for Max...and it was *WINDY*...just Arrow and Gemini to start.  Gunter and I bussed it over to Jane, where they finally got the challenger running.  Did a couple laps there (*insane* line, S-ing down to the goose and partway back), and then met up with James.  Loads of fun busting through bumps and trees with the 3 of us.  They ended up opening Gauge and Zephyr and Hi-Lo eventually...which helped thin out the crowds.  On our way to get max, we had to do Brian&#x2019;s....probably the best conditions I&#x2019;ve ever seen it!!!&#xD;&#xD;Finally on Sunday, they opened back up Pano and Eagle.  We ended up doing a Belle lap...conditions weren&#x2019;t great in there...too crusty.  The runs around the Black Coal cliff were good...packed down but not icy...so we did a bunch of laps in there.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
