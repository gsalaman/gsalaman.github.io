    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Started over at the Zephyr; worked our way over to Jane fairly quickly.  No Cheshire Cat, but Sidetrack and Sleeper were open.  One run down there, and Alli&#x2019;s calves weren&#x2019;t happy with her, so Gunter, Max, and I did a couple laps.  After lunch, they opened up Gandy again...MUCH softer and less nasties than it looked from the bottom.  Max was done after a little, so Mom came and got him, and Gunter and I played around some more....hit more bumps, a little trees, and some jumps.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
