    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Max has Thanksgiving week off; with snow in the forecast, we headed up to the hills on Saturday.  Sunday was a WP day...they got 7&#x201D; of new snow, but still only had Sale and the Discovery Park stuff open.  Copper, on the other hand, has the Blacks under Excellerator, and just opened the Timberline lift...so while Max and Mom decided to stay home, I day-tripped it from Fraser on Monday.&#xD;&#xD;The drive was evil both ways...2:15...with a slick pass and treacherous tunnel.  It was *totally* worth it though...they just opened up &#x201C;The Moz&#x201D;, and got some fresh pow!  Spent the late morning doing runs under the Timberline, then headed to the Excellerator to work on my bumps.  Ahhhh!!!!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
