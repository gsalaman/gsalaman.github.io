    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The storm track is changing...Opensnow forecast light showers on friday, with 4-6&#x201D; on Saturday.  Alli had a work party, so Max and I drove up early on friday.  The pass was slick...turns out we got 7&#x201D; of bonus phresheez on friday night.  Mom drove up late that evening, and we had a decent powder day on Saturday, even though all Winter Park still has open is Cranmer, Sale, and the Discovery Park stuff.  It was *very* crowded, but it *did* give me the chance to break out my S7s.  &#xD;&#xD;Got 7&#x201D; on Saturday Night, and Sunday was *COLD*...single digit highs.  Mom &amp; Max decided to stay in, but I put the CH4 on the S7s and went out to get another morning worth of powder.   I&#x2019;m not in mid-season shape, so I quit around lunchtime.&#xD;&#xD;Here are the charts from Sat &amp; Sun.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
