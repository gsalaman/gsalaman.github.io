    <richText>&lt;b&gt;G&#xFC;nter and I did a run to Copper on Monday...figured that if it was cruiser day, we&#x2019;d go someplace with more stuff open.  They definitely had more terrain than winter park, but still, mostly just cruisers.  The bumps were in about the same troughed-out rocky condition.  &#xD;&#xD;It was a little more crowded than earlier in the season, so I wasn&#x2019;t able to go full throttle on some of the runs, but still, respectable speeds. :)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
