			<h2>X-Mas Break</h2>
			<h3 style="color:red">Friday, December 25, 2020</h3>
			<p>So we were planning on spending most of xmas break up in Fraser but we were worried about how the crowds would be due to WP not requiring reservations.  Then, on Dec 15, they announce that due to the crowds, they're going to do reservations, starting on the 19th...and you can only hold 10 oustanding reservations per pass.  Mixed feelings; will be good to keep the crowds down, but worried that we won't be able to get that week between xmas and new years.  Jumped on the system right as it opened, and grabbed all the days we wanted for break.</p>
			<p>Comp center folks were pretty grumpy...they had to grab saturdays, and weekends dissappeared pretty quickly...although it's *looked* like you can get day-of pretty readilly.</p>
			<p>The snow hasn't been great; Sunnyside opened just as our break started, and the C-Lift was sketch.  No pano, no eagle.  Still, was good to get out. </p>
			<p>Had fun running around on xmas day...got this great shot of the entrance to outhouse:</p>
