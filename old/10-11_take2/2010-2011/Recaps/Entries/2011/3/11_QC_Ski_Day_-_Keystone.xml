    <richText>Started the day with some warmup-runs with Bhavna, Simon, Lucille, Mark, Rick, and others.  Then went to the Outback, met up with PJ, and did some bumps with him and Mark and Rick.  After a couple runs there, Mark and Rick split off, and PJ and I played in the Black Forest area.  Pretty cool back there...similar to Eagle Wind.  Met up with Bijan, and did some other laps there.  &#xD;&#xD;Started to get tired, met up with Bhavna and crew for some more cruiser runs (and one mini-bump run).  Back to the bus, and a typical ride home.</richText>
