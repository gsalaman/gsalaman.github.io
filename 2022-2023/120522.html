			<h2>Alli's Knee</h2>
			<h3 style="color:red">Monday, December 5, 2022</h3>
			<p>Jane opened on Friday; Alli and I drove up on Sunday to hit the slopes on Monday.  Around lunchtime, she peels off to go grab food at the Jane base...and does a nasty twist/crash on the way down.  As she tells it, she was rocking the bumps, and had her right ski pop off, swing around, and tomahawk right below the left leg.  Skiied down on one leg to the base, and called me...we got her home ASAP and started the ice processes.</p>
			
			<p>She got an appointment for wednesday afternoon; did Xrays and picked up a brace and crutches on thursday, and then had an appointment with the orthopedist on Friday.  Xrays below:</p>

       	    </div>
			
			<p>She has a tibial plateau fracture...got her an appointment that moring for the CT scans down in Aurora.  The good news:  soft tissue looks good.  The bad news:  if she wants to stay super-active, we've gotta fix that break.  Surgery scheduled for Saturday.</p>
			
			<p>Dr. Zaronius was the surgeon...he had to tamp the broken segment back up so that is level with the rest of the plateau, then drop in screws and a plate.   Here are the "after" xrays:</p>

			<div class="imageContainer">
  				<img src="post2.jpg" alt="post2" width="70%">
       	    </div>
			
			<p>Although the surgery went well, the recovery has been rough...lots of pain.  Next set of Xray evals are later in January; hopefully she can go partial weight bearing then.</p>
			
			<p>Wardrobe note:  When she was rocking the dress, meaning she skiied every day this season in costume!!!</p>
