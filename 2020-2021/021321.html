			<h2>President's Day Weekend</h2>
			<h3 style="color:red">Saturday, Febrary 13, 2021</h3>
			<p>Max had Thursday through Monday off, so we all headed up for some skiing.&nbsp; Forecast for Saturday was for snow; luckilly, reservations opened up on Friday, so Alli and I grabbed 'em!&nbsp; (Max took the day off). Ended up getting about 8"; we left at about 7:30 to try and get some pow before it was all skied of.  Instead of dealing the the Jane madness, we decided to suck it up an park at the vintage...wanted to hit one of my favorite new stashes over at the Ridge.  We figured we'd get early chair at Arrow or Gemini, then rush over to the ridge.</p> <p>Ended up at the base at around 8, and noticed that folks were getting on the gondola.  Yup, they opened it early!  No line, so we took advantage of that, and had fresh tracks until 10ish.  Vid below:</p>
