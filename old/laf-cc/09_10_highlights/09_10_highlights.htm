<h1>2009 - 2010 Season Highlights</h1>
<hr>
<p>Opening weekend in November.&nbsp; Pretty typical...only Village Way, Larry 
Sale, and Porcupine open.&nbsp; Had a couple bumps on the side of Porcupine that 
Max turned into jumps:</p>

<p>Taking the Endeavour Lift...snow making on Cranmer, with the hopes that they 
open it soon!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="snowmaking_from_end.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>A pic from the Vintage lot...looking longingly over at Jane.&nbsp; &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="jane.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>And, back at the house, put up the tree, and have Max guard it.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_tree.jpg" width="1024" height="1365"></p><hr>
<p>Standard operating procedure:&nbsp; drive up on friday night.&nbsp; Depending 
on how late we left, Max would be asleep by the time we hit Fraser.&nbsp; Alli 
and I would run in, dump him on the couch, and then turn on the water and turn 
up the heat.&nbsp; Most of the time, his Puppy needed to stay home, but here's a 
pic from early in the season:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_sleep.jpg" width="1024" height="1365"></p><hr>
<p>Thanksgiving weekend, and a pic from the Zephyr, looking over at Parry's 
Peak.&nbsp; Note that Upper Hughes isn't open yet...and Railbender over on Jane 
isn't all Moguled out yet.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="parry_early.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>...and some snowmaking, first on Vista Dome:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="snowmaking_vista.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>...and then for the park...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="snowmaking_park.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p><hr>
<p>Xmas time!&nbsp; Kate, Sean, Pam, Dennis, Sharon, and Gunter all came out.&nbsp; 
Here's the boys:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_gunter_xmas.jpg" width="1024" height="845"></p><hr>
<p>I got a pair of powder skis this year...the Rossi S7s.&nbsp; They're 
*awesome*, but I cursed the snowfall by getting 'em...we only had a couple 
powder days this year, and nothing truly epic.&nbsp; My favorite moment...doing 
some tree trails over xmas with Michelle and Gunter, hitting some deep pow, and 
having Michelle sink up to her waist.&nbsp; I ski down past her, floating just 
above my boot, even though I've probably got twice her mass.&nbsp; Fun!!!&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="new_skis.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>This pic is me posing with 'em on corridor.</p><hr>
<p>Max hits the bumps under Cranmer.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_cranmer.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Here he is up on Edelweiss.&nbsp; As usual, he's looking for some challenge</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_edel.jpg" width="1024" height="768">.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>Pam on Edelweiss:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pam_edel.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Sean on Edelweiss:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="sean_edel.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>...and Kate:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="kate_edel.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Rod, Michelle, Amy, and Ken also came up and stayed at the Y.&nbsp; Alli and 
I *had* to get Rod the perfect outfit....I *LOVE* the look on his face here:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="rod_jacket1.jpg" width="1024" height="1365"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="rod_jacket2.jpg" width="1024" height="1365"></p>
<p>And yes, if you wear the Jacket, you have to Ski the part:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="rod_jacket3.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p><hr>
<p>Max *totally* rocked this year.&nbsp; This is from xmas break, before he 
started his lessons.&nbsp; I'm always pushing for doing the Panoramic, and this 
time, he actually wanted to do the bumps under the lift.&nbsp; He did pretty 
good, but the boarders in the background were having some issues.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_under_pano.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p><hr>
<p>So earlier in the season, we had an instance where Max and I going down Mary 
Jane Trail, and I want to do Gandy Dancer.&nbsp; Max isn't up for it, so I show 
him where (I think) he needs to wait for me to come out.&nbsp; I do the bumps, 
look around, and notice that spot is *way* above me on the mountain...and there 
is Max, faithfully waiting.&nbsp; I call to him, but he can't hear me from that 
far away.&nbsp; I look up, and consider hiking it....nah.&nbsp; I ski down, take 
the lift, and meet him.&nbsp; &quot;Daddy, you took a *really* long time!&quot; We agree 
at that point that it's better to ski with the 2-way radios.</p>
<p>Here comes the defining moment...later in xmas break.&nbsp; I've got on my 
bandits, and Max and I are darting through the tree paths under where the 
timberline lift used to be. I'm following him...he makes a sharp left turn into 
the powder.&nbsp; My bandit submerges, and the ski pops off (common 
occurrence....I'm gonna need to get something a little wider/longer for my 
default ski).&nbsp; I dust off the snow, and pull out the radio.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&quot;Max, Daddy fell...wait for me&quot;.&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; Get up.&nbsp; 
Call him again.&nbsp; &quot;Daddy, I fell too!&nbsp;&nbsp; My ski came off&quot;&nbsp; Oh 
crap...now I've gotta hike and find him and help him get his ski back on in the 
powder.&nbsp; I ski down a little to look up for him.&nbsp; Go down to this 
spot...&quot;I can see you!&nbsp; Do you need me to come up?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Nope...I got my 
ski back on&quot;.&nbsp; And down he comes...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_trees.jpg" width="1023" height="887"></p>
<p>My little rockstar!</p><hr>
<p>Doing tree paths with Gunter in the Juniper area.&nbsp; Inconsistent 
powder...one time through Gunter finds a tree well.&nbsp; The way he tells it: 
&quot;I'm skiing down, close to the edge, and I get a little too close to the 
tree...and it sucks me in.&nbsp; I end up with my skis above me, looking up at 
this beautiful snow coming down, and realize I can't just pop out of my 
binding.&quot;&nbsp; Note I was a little past him, played the &quot;Marco Polo&quot; 
game, tried 
calling, but no success.&nbsp; Was on my way back up when he buzzed me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here's another wipeout, with a &quot;no, don't help me, I can get up&quot;.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_powder.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p><hr>
<p>We're now at mid January, and a bunch of the Derailer stuff is open.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="derailer.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="junction.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="patrol.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>...and yeah, I did let the ski patrol pass.&nbsp; :)</p><hr>
<p>While exploring, Max and I found a hut off the ridge under the panoramic.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_hut_top.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<hr>
<p>We did the 1x/MCS ditch day again in January.&nbsp; One pic from the lift:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="work.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<p>Took those folks through the trees.&nbsp; Stan hit a little trouble...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="stan1.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="stan2.jpg" width="1266" height="1212"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><hr>
<p>End of January, and a shot of Gunter down by Little Raven:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_tele.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Same day.&nbsp; One benefit of the beetle kill is that they've been 
aggressively thinning the trees.&nbsp; Gunter and I did a *lot* of 
exploring...this is from the trees east of buckaroo.&nbsp; Hit the wide spot, 
heading back to the run, and had one of my bandits submerge.&nbsp; Definitely a 
photo op. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="glenn_pow.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p><hr>
<p>The beginning of feb, a little snow in the trees off of thunderbird.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="thunder1.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="thunder2.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Same day, over by the &quot;Aces and Eights&quot; turnoff:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="aces-begin.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<hr>
<p>Gunter comes out over a weekend when Alli is doing her rugby thing.&nbsp; She 
calls friday night to ask how it's going, and this is my response:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="big_house.jpg" width="640" height="478"></p>
<p>The next day, exploring the trees off Cranmer, we find another hut:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="cranmer_hut.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Meeting up with the Stephens kids, Gunter decides it's time for a &quot;super 
train&quot;!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="train.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>

<p>Max in the powder by switchyard:</p>

<hr>
<p>Last week of February.&nbsp; Gunter comes out (woo-hoo!), and first order of 
business:&nbsp; the meadow.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="alli_meadow.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_meadow.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Note Gunter needs fresh tracks...</p>
<p>Second order of business:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="alli_gunter_belle.jpg" width="1024" height="1202"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="alli_gunter_belle2.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>After lunch, we meet up with Kev and Claudia (they're doing a day trip).&nbsp; 
Kev, Gunter, Alli, and I do a bunch of the stuff under eagle wind.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="alli_little_raven.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="kev_little_raven.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<p>Then comes Sunday.&nbsp; Max, Gunter, and I tag up with Matthias.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_gunter_matthias.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<p>....and we head over to eagle wind.&nbsp; No good action shots here, but 
loads of fun!&nbsp; Here's Max and Gunter on the lift:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_gunter_eagle_lift.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<hr>
<p>So it's the last day of lessons (March 6), and the pass closes late the night 
before.&nbsp; Good news for us; we're already up there.&nbsp; Lauren makes it, 
but only Quinn and Phoenix are the only other 2 classmates that make it.&nbsp; 
Hmmm...not too bad...Quinn is decent, even if Phoenix is a little bit of a 
cry-baby.&nbsp; Send them off, and I go out to play.&nbsp; Map the side of Allan 
Phipps and the Nastar course for Phresheez, and run into them.&nbsp; They're 
going in for lunch...Lauren asks if I've been over to eagle wind.&nbsp; I say 
&quot;no, but I'll go scout it!&quot;.&nbsp; Head over there, and it's pretty good...not 
too icy.&nbsp; She brings the class over, and they do Thunderbird.&nbsp; Max 
loves it, 'cause Lauren goes &quot;Okay, Max, you did this one last weekend, you 
lead!&quot;&nbsp; He gets so bubbly when encouraged.</p>
<p>I ski a bunch of laps with them, do the upper switchyard trees (where Phoenix 
wipes out and makes Lauren hike about 100 yards uphill), and then follow 'em 
down to the Nastar course. Max and Quinn race....one good action shot here:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_nastar1.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<hr>
<p>The next day, and another great first:&nbsp; Max doing Trestle.&nbsp; (March 
7)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_trestle.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<hr>
<p>Spring Break Week!&nbsp; The bad news (just for me)...I ended up getting 
sick, and had a throat thing all week (and into the following week).&nbsp; 
Nothing like taking vacation and spending it sick.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; The good news 
though was Gunter came out...that always makes the week more fun!&nbsp; </p>
<p>We also did two private lessons for Max with Tony (since he was rocking so 
much). On Friday I tried skiing a little, and followed them for a little bit 
(not such a good idea...especially when the warm-up run is an icy outhouse).&nbsp; 
I followed them up to the top, and where do you think they went?</p>
<p><img border="0" src="tony_max.jpg" width="1024" height="730"></p>
<p>Max's first double-black:&nbsp; The south headwall.&nbsp; 3/26/10, age 6.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next weekend, and I've recovered some.&nbsp; Time to hit the Derailer 
runs!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_derail.jpg" width="1024" height="884"></p>

<hr>
<p>Doing some more exploring off the trees in Vasquez Ridge.&nbsp; Found this 
little clearing between Stagecoach and Sundance.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="stagecoach_trees.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<p>Some decent snow on Golden Spike...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="spike.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<hr>
<p>Closing weekend.&nbsp; Saturday, Gunter and I went off to hit our favorite 
runs.&nbsp; Here's a shot from the bottom of Left Hand:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_lefthand.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<p>And, for closing day, Alli dressed up as Mary Jane.</p>
