    <richText>&#xA0;Woke up to 5.5" on the ground...enough to cover the icy bumps.&#xA0; Gunter, Max and I headed out early...did a BUNCH of trees and fresh tracks.&#xA0; Tried to get over to Eagle Wind, but although they said the run was open, it was roped off (so we had to ditch into the switchyard trees).&#xA0; Showed them the brakeman trees, did lower tophers, the frenchman trees, the do-or-die trees...all good!&#xD;&#xD;And, the highlight:  Gunter does the bridge between Cranmer and Outrigger! </richText>
