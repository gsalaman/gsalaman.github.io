    <richText>&lt;b&gt;President&#x2019;s Day weekend...Max doesn&#x2019;t have school Thursday through Monday, and Alli is gonna be in Atlanta for a Rugby Tourney.  That means BOYS WEEKEND!!!&#xD;&#xD;WP reported 6.5&#x201D; of fresh on Thursday...we hit Short Haul first.  Max ended up back-seating a jump, and losing his pole (and his glove!)  He went in for a break...I had to do a GLORIOUS lap through Belle (see first vid below).&#xD;&#xD;After that, he was ready to come back out.  We ended up doing the Chutes a bunch of times, a bunch of Bumps, and, of course, upper Tophers.  Vid #2 also below.  Quote from Max:  &#x201C;I think this is the best day of the season&#x201D;.  &lt;/b&gt;</richText>
