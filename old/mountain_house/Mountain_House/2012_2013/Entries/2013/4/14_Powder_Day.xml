    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Max got sick on friday, so he didn&#x2019;t want to come up this weekend.  Alli was good with me going solo...I was tracking a storm supposed to come in on Saturday night.  Spent saturday in spring conditions; met up with Matthias and did some more slushy bumps.  Sunday didn&#x2019;t disappoint...woke up to 10&#x201D;!!!  Hit MJ early, got in line at 8:20, and snagged 10th chair going up.  &lt;/b&gt;</richText>
