    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Alli had a bunch of runs she wanted to bag today:  Belle, the Cirque, the Chutes, and Brians.  WP got a bunch of snow yesterday during the day (7&#x201D;), and with Pano closed most of the day, Belle was definitely top of the target list.  Met up with James; headed that way, until we saw the Cirque was open.  HAD to hike that...came down west headwall.&#xD;&#xD;Did a couple laps through Left Hand and Belle after that...Alli went off to lunch, while we did another lap through Belle and Eagle.  Met up with her after, and nabbed Brian&#x2019;s...then headed over and did the Chutes.  Finished off the day with Tophers....good snow, good day!!!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
