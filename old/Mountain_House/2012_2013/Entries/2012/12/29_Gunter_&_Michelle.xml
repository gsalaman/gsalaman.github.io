    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Pano was scheduled to open today, so I headed straight over there after dropping off Max at Freestyle.  Got early tracks...the trees under the lift were good, but you couldn&#x2019;t turn or you&#x2019;d stop.  The far side of the bowl was pretty good; did some laps through there before meeting up with Gunter and Michelle.  We did a lap through the switchyard trees before heading over to Vasquez.  &#xD;&#xD;The best snow, though, was under pine cliffs.  Did an unintentional 3:57 game (Iron Horse), along with one last run with Gunter through there.&#xD;&#xD;Fun vid below of us playing around.  :)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
