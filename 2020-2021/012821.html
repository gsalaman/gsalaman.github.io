			<h2>Bump Work</h2>
			<h3 style="color:red">Thursday, January 28, 2021</h3>
			<p>More storm chasing...we were supposed to get snow tuesday night and wednesday night, so I came up solo.  Unfortunately, those didn't pan out...only got a dusting both nights.  So, after some strugggles last week, I took the opportunity to work on my bumps.</p>
			<p>Definitely went better...I was focusing on keeping my shoulders down hill and not letting either my outside leg nor my inside pole drag too far back.  I'm not sure whether it was the focus or the fact that I didn't drink the night before, but it went well!!!</p>
			<p>Stayed mostly away from Pano...that's the only place on the mountain with a line...but I did jump into the Switchyard trees.  Still a little bony, but I took my time and got that shot above!</p>
			<p> This is where I'm gonna want a new div:  previous and next bars</p>
