    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Headed up solo to Copper; they opened the Flyer lift yesterday.  Coin flip between them and Loveland...Copper&#x2019;s top-to-bottom doing Excellerator was more appealing.  Good choice...there were some bumps cutting through to Mine Dump, and they opened some of Hallelujah for part of the day.&#xD;&#xD;The vid from below:  cutting from Mine Dump to Trail #20, and hitting some powder.  Alli is pleased to see that this is one of the few times I fell *forward* (rather than back-seating it).  I love the cheering from the lift afterwards...&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
