## iWeb blog entry annoyance number...
Looks like iWeb is using a custom JavaScript to parse blog_main.xml to find the summary strings.  This means if you want the summary text to match, you need to fix it in blog_main.xml.  Note that this won't refresh in Dreamweaver's live view...you have to close and open it.
