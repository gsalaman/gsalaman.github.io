    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The 2013 season went out with a bang...we had the powder day last sunday, followed by a bunch more monday (along with a closed pass).  Was thinking about catching powder flu on wed, but the snow didn&#x2019;t pan out.  Instead, there was a blast wednesday afternoon, so I headed up then.  Got 6&#x201D; wednesday night...and had a great ditch day thursday.&#xD;&#xD;Saturday and sunday only had dustings...but still, they kept eagle and parsenn and the ridge open for closing weekend, so I can&#x2019;t complain.  Charts below...didn&#x2019;t stick around for the C-Lift festivities on sunday...not enough energy.  :)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
