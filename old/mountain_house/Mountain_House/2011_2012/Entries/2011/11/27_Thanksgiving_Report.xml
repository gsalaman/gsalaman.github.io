    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Went up to Fraser after the big meal with my parents on thursday.  Looked at the report between WP and copper...copper had more stuff open.  Max decided he didn&#x2019;t want to ski, and Mom was &#x201C;iffy&#x201D;, so they stayed back, whilst I drove down to copper.  Did the pass rather than 9 through Kremmling; takes about 75 min with clear roads and limited traffic.  They opened Windsong under the timberline, so I could bomb that run.  Checked Phresheez, thought the speed must be a mistake, so bombed it again.  Here are the charts:&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
