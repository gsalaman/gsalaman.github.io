    <richText>Alli had rugby this weekend, so, to continue the tradition, Gunter came out for &#x201C;boys weekend&#x201D;.  Max had class, so I had to do some show &#x2018;n tell, and show Gunter the Skis and the plaque for Tophers.&#xD;&#xD;This is a legendary underground area at Jane.  The story goes that Topher hit a tree well and died, and to mark it, they put his skis on the tree where he bit it.  There&#x2019;s also a plaque you can see from Corona way if you look hard.  &#xD;&#xD;No vids from the day, but here are a couple pics...&#xD;</richText>
