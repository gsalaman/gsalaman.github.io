    <richText>&lt;b&gt;With Winter Park pushing out their opening from the 12th to the 15th, Alli decided to hit Loveland on Wednesday with Danica....and they let me tag along!  Although the temp was very cold, it didn&#x2019;t feel too bad...and they had a bunch of snow, so it wasn&#x2019;t icy.  Had Spillway and Richards open, but no Chair 2 or 6 yet.  Still, was an awesome first day!!!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
