    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Decided to hit the mid-week bump jam.  Firm conditions today; ended up in Tom&#x2019;s group (the good news) with the old-farts (bad news).  Meant for much more talking and much less skiing, as evidenced by the charts above.&#xD;&#xD;Got a couple good tips out of it this time.  Tom really wanted us to stay over our skis, and not push the outside ski (and lean uphill in the process).  Started with the &#x201C;lead with the inside ski&#x201D; tip...more of a reminder for me, but I&#x2019;ve noticed I&#x2019;m doing the outside lead.  The one that *really* opened it up for me was the two pole drag:  ski with both poles dragging the snow.  This forces you to lower the downhill hand/shoulder (although I need to make sure I don&#x2019;t let it get behind me), and also torques the lower body into a counter-balance position.  That was my main thing to work on.&#xD;&#xD;He also wants me to finish my turns...I&#x2019;m starting the next bump too soon.  Now, just more practice...  &lt;/b&gt;</richText>
