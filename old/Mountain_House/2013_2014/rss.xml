    <description>Welcome to the 2013/2014 season recap!  The farmer’s almanac said that we’d be in for a good snow year...and they were right!  October and November were a little above average...leading to Jane opening before Thanksgiving (woo hoo!).  Xmas saw Pano and Eagle....well ahead of average sched.  Chutes opened on 1/11, followed by Belle on 2/2, and finally the Cirque on 2/5. (although it really didn’t start in earnest until mid-march)  Note we did MUCH better than the rest of the country:  Tahoe was dry (~40% average)...with SLC sitting at 70-80%.  We were in the 130s most of the year...snow graph below for the Colorado River Basin.&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Second graph below, comparison year-over-year.  Note Glenn made a second-best...Max and Alli were below they’re year-over-year averages.  Gunter was above last year, but not as good as 2 and 3 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Gunter came out, met up with James.   Spring Skiing on Sat...loads of slushy bumps and a bunch of park laps.  Good stuff....</description>

Alli had picked up the Sled passes, so right after that, we headed for the cirque...jumped into Cornice Canyon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunday started off with a lap through Destiny and Waterfall with Alli and Max; they went off early for lunch, and I pulled another lap through the west headwall...and then met up with Gunter for one more lap...this time through the south headwall.  </description>

WP got a bunch of snow yesterday during the day (7”), and with Pano closed most of the day, Belle was definitely top of the target list.  Met up with James; headed that way, until we saw the Cirque was open.  HAD to hike that...came down west headwall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did a couple laps through Left Hand and Belle after that...Alli went off to lunch, while we did another lap through Belle and Eagle.  Met up with her after, and nabbed Brian’s...then headed over and did the Chutes.  Finished off the day with Tophers....good snow, good day!!!</description>

Originally, the forcasts had called for 3ish inches, but as of saturday, it wasn’t looking good.  Enter sunday morning:  7” at WP!!!  Woo hoo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day started off pretty typical...no pano or eagle because of winds.  Did Jane laps through the Columbine tress, Harolds+Weather Station, and Tophers until Eagle opened up.  Left hand was glorious...fresh tracks pretty much on demand.  Kept peeking over until they opened up pano...then it was time for Belle.  </description>

Max took a rest day on friday; Gunter and I did a bunch of laps through Eagle (left hand was pretty good).  Broke for lunch (Gunter needed to do a conf call); I took a tumble above switchyard and busted the break on my binding.  Skied tentatively after that...took it back home, and we figured out the screw had just popped off (whew!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saturday was class for Max...and it was *WINDY*...just Arrow and Gemini to start.  Gunter and I bussed it over to Jane, where they finally got the challenger running.  Did a couple laps there (*insane* line, S-ing down to the goose and partway back), and then met up with James.  Loads of fun busting through bumps and trees with the 3 of us.  They ended up opening Gauge and Zephyr and Hi-Lo eventually...which helped thin out the crowds.  On our way to get max, we had to do Brian’s....probably the best conditions I’ve ever seen it!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally on Sunday, they opened back up Pano and Eagle.  We ended up doing a Belle lap...conditions weren’t great in there...too crusty.  The runs around the Black Coal cliff were good...packed down but not icy...so we did a bunch of laps in there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

That means BOYS WEEKEND!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP reported 6.5” of fresh on Thursday...we hit Short Haul first.  Max ended up back-seating a jump, and losing his pole (and his glove!)  He went in for a break...I had to do a GLORIOUS lap through Belle (see first vid below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, he was ready to come back out.  We ended up doing the Chutes a bunch of times, a bunch of Bumps, and, of course, upper Tophers.  Vid #2 also below.  Quote from Max:  “I think this is the best day of the season”.  </description>

Alli rented some Super7s to see what this downhill fat ski thing was all about.  Max was supposed to have a comp on Saturday, but because of wind, they ended up closing Eskimo (along with Hi-Lo, Pano, Pioneer, and Eagle)....so the comp got cancelled.  Took her through the do-or-die trees and upper Tohpers...she’s hooked.   :)  They ended up going back early on Saturday, so I was on my own for Sunday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drove down early to Jane, and there’s a line of cars waiting at the pass.  Woo hoo!  Pass closed; small crowds!!!  I end up getting 11th chair up the Gauge, and have some fun first runs (although the snow wasn’t all that deep...still, can’t complain).  They opened up the back stagecoach gate, even though eagle wasn’t open...decent stashes back there.  I then had an epic run through the frenchy trees, and nailed the frenchman bumps.  Chutes were open, so I headed over there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decide to start with No-Name.  Couple turns in, and I backseat, and kaboom....yard sale.  I start sliding...slowly.  Get my feet pointed down, still can’t stop.  Slide pretty much to the bottom...you can see from the Google Earth image above how far.  Wait for a little bit, but since the crowds are low, no one else is coming down.  Fine.  I start the hike back up to my skis and poles...about 300’ later, I’m there.  Needless to say, I’m *still* a little shaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Checked out the elevation change; looks to be only about 200’, which would put this at 30 degrees.  Sure feels like closer to 45.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I’ve got the hike marked as the yellow line above...the GPS didn’t do so hot tracking it (probably because I was hugging the hill going up).  Google’s elevation profile is below...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here’s an older chute pic, with the hike marked with the black line...</description>

Tuesday AM brought 11” to WP, followed by another 11” on Thursday and 14” on Friday.  With the big game on Sunday, everyone was heading up for Saturday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dropped Max off at comp center Saturday AM, then Alli and I headed straight for Belle.  Glorious!  Alli bailed; I did another lap in there, and then the Eagle had mechanical issues.  Got stuck on the egress for a while before bailing out to Pioneer (which then also had evil lines).  Worked my way back to Jane...good snow in the trees over there (Frenchy, Tophers...)  Vid below.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Just the boys...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They had Left Hand open over at Eagle...loads of snow, but a little crusty.  The better news:  all Chutes were open...and I think I had my best run down no-name.  The top of Baldy still has a couple spots that give me trouble.  Note it was *crazy* busy...everyone trying to get that fresh snow day before the Broncos game.  Graphs from Saturday below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunday was the first of the internal series.  Temps were in the low 20s, but it was windy and snowy, which made the conditions tough.  Max was in the group of J5s (9 &amp;amp; 10)...he did a great run and placed 7th!</description>

At the beginning, you had to cut over after going down a little to the trees...rocky up there.  Just as we were about to bail, we saw patrol opening up the top road, with the warning:  it’s rocky in there!  We blitzed over to the Black Coal rope...good snow, but yeah, the occasional rock.  Best snow was tucked under the trees after the cliff, heading towards left hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bailed out and did a run with Alli (it was a Jane day).  Last run of the day:  Runaway South was open...but probably shouldn’t have been.</description>

Checked the WP site:  9.5”!!!  Headed out early...Alli came with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First run:  tracks through Trestle.  Next:  Upper Switchyard trees...untracked.  Then over to Eagle; they’ve only got Thunderbird and a little bit of Little Raven open, so it got tracked out pretty quick.  Spent the rest of the day playing around in all the usual tree spots...including exploring the cannonball trees.</description>

Alli brought out the bandits, and we did a bunch of runs together...starting with the warm-up run down outhouse.  Note:  still sketchy.  Hi-Lo trees and Pioneer were where the best snow was...they also opened up the north side of the bowl, which meant you could do the upper switchyard trees.</description>

At that point, I had to run downstairs and prep the S7s.  :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spent the morning with Alli...headed up to Pano.  Did a couple runs up there, but the snow was in a weird state, so we bailed fairly quickly.  Trestle was open, and was glorious!  Hadn’t been tracked out, so the face was more similar to the headwalls than giant moguls with rocks.  Fun!  Did a run through the newly opened Boiler...good conditions there too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After lunch, headed over to Pioneer (good snow), and after Alli bailed, headed back to the Jane side for some more runs.  Good day!</description>

Saturday, Max had his first Comp Center day of the season (with Jody)...Gunter and Karen were sleeping in, so after a few runs with Alli (and some encouragement), I went to hit the newly opened Vasquez Ridge.  Buckaroo trees were *awesome* in there....easy to make fresh tracks!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other openings:  the C-lift has everything around to Needles Eye.  Sunnyside has Roundhouse, Bluebell, and Edleweiss (no Columbine or Trestle yet).  Sidetrack is open, but no Pine Cliffs or Sleepy Hollow (so no Sleepy-trees).  Everything except the top is open under the horse...you can cut over now even higher (drops ya right below the rocky-nasty section on Arrowhead).  And, they dropped the rope on outhouse...but that’s probably still one of the sketchiest runs out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLD weekend...Saturday didn’t feel that bad with the sun shining and teens for temp, but Sunday was single digit.  Yay for CH4.</description>

No new snow to speak of, but WP opened Jane on Tuesday.  We all headed up to the hill friday morning; Alli broke out the new dress!  Vid Below.</description>

Checked the reports first thing in the morning...although WP announced Jane is opening on next tuesday, the Zephyr still isn’t running (just Sale and all the Discovery Park stuff).  Loveland has some of the blues off of Chair 2 (Firecut &amp;amp; Drifter) and Chair 6 (Keno, Blackjack), but Copper has some of the stuff under Timberline *and* some of the blacks under Excellerator.  I convinced them to do the drive.  :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[and yes, the drive was a little evil.  almost 2 hrs, bad traffic, slippery conditions.  but it was worth it]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mom went over to timberline early...Max and I hit the blacks. REAL MOGULS!!!  Yay!!!  Had a blast...vid and stats below.</description>

WP had opened on wednesday with parkway and porcupine...Max and I decided to check the snow report first thing in the morning to decide where to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loveland has Drifter and Firecut under chair 2...they got 2” of snow.&lt;br/&gt;Copper opened up the flyer on friday...they had 5” of new snow.&lt;br/&gt;Bad news for both:  cold and windy, so we decided to just hit the local mountain.  Not the most challenging terrain, but at least we had fun...and I spotted these two:</description>

They had Lower Richards and Spillway open, and Saturday was supposed to be a nice, warm, no wind day...so I convinced Max to go with me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Headed up to the mountain house friday night, checked the report again, and Chair 6 was due to open as well...bonus!!!  Saturday morning came along, we grabbed our stuff, scrapped off the storage wax from the Juvys and Rockers, and headed across the pass.  Good day...while it took me a little to find my balance, Max was a rockstar right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typical speed chart for early season:  2:1 lift to run.  </description>
