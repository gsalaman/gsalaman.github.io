    <richText>Closing day...Alli dressed up again as Jane.&#xA0; Did a front-side run with her and Max, then took off to the bowl.&#xA0; Got another 6" last night, but the temps stayed warm, so it was heavy powder.&#xA0; Had the S7's, and they did *great* with it.&#xA0; Did a bunch of Bowl laps (far side), and a bunch of laps through upper switchyard trees.&#xA0; Had to head over to c-lift for the closing madness...Alli and I met up with Max over there.&#xA0; </richText>
