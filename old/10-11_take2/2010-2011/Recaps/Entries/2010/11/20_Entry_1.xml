    <richText>Starting out the day, had a work fire explode.  Did some business from the lift, but I couldn&#x2019;t risk running Phresheez on the Droid and not being able to do email/phone.  Note, I fixed that shortly thereafter by getting a spare battery for the Droid and keeping both charged.&#xD;&#xD;Played around a little with helmet-cam.  Got some good shots of Max doing Retta&#x2019;s, at least until he took a major fall (way in front of me).  That pretty much ended his day; I ended up playing around a little more in the trees.</richText>
