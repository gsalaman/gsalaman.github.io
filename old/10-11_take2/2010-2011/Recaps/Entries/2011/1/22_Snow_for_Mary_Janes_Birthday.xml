    <richText>Woke up to a couple inches of fresh pow,&#xA0;and it snowed all day. &#xA0;Dropped Max off at the sharks, then Matthias and I did Outhouse as the warmup.&#xA0; Good stuff!&#xA0; Met up with Alli, Lucille, and Gunter over on the Jane side...Alli was skiing in&#xA0;her "MJ" dress (very cool!!!)&#xA0;&#xA0;Twas windy, so Pano and Eagle Wind were closed.&#xA0; They all stopped for lunch, but I skied through it...they opened the eagle wind trails (even though the lifts were closed), so I had to do a couple old-school laps through there.&#xA0; AWESOME snow back there...I was second-tracks the first time through.&#xA0; Awesome day!!! &#xD;</richText>
