    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Did get a little snow yesterday...WP reports 6.5&#x201D;.  They still only have Phantom Bridge, Little 10, and Freeriders open over at the C-lift, and they&#x2019;re sketchy.  No sunnyside, parsenn, or eagle wind yet either...Retta&#x2019;s, Outrigger, Over-and-underwood and Engledive are still closed as well...and Pioneer is sketchy.&#xD;&#xD;The comp center put on a mini competition today...Max wasn&#x2019;t so sure to start, but after talking to Dave (and running the course a bunch) yesterday, he decided to sign up.&#xD;It was a course on Lower Parkway...some tight alpine turns, then a bump field, then going through a couple teepees to the end.  Speed didn&#x2019;t matter; you were judged on form.  Max was in the J6&#x2019;s (8 and under), and he did a great job! &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Later that day, we met up with Matthias and played around some.  &lt;/b&gt;</richText>
