    <richText>Woke up to 2" of fresh, so I hit the slopes early.&#xA0; The Pano Trees were better than the bowl, so I did a couple runs there, then headed to eagle wind.&#xA0; Stalked Matthias and Ray, saw they were at Pioneer with Tressa, so headed over there and did a couple nice runs down Gambler and Aces and Eights.&#xA0; Lucille's lesson ended at noon, so we then caught up with them.&#xA0; Gunter came out and did some tele-drills in preparation for his lesson...Tressa and I joined him whilst everyone else did lunch.&#xA0; Had to fetch his poles from under the pony...(did he do that on purpose?)&#xD;Hit a bunch of the mountain...good day! &#xD;</richText>
