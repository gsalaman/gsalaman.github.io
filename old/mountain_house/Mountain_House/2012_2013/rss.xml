    <description>Interesting season.  We started out brutal (only one storm early nov until december), but the storm track changed in December, and we got some decent snow.  It was dry for all of Jan, but we got some more dumps after that, making the conditions better than last season.  Eagle opened beginning of feb, followed by Belle and the Cirque during president’s weekend.  The chutes were also open a number of times...managed to do those a few times...but Jeff’s, Hole-in-the-wall, and Awe Chute still scare me.  Over in the cirque, the south headwall was never open...but I did Playing Field, the West Headwall, Cowboys (with max), Certainty, and Destiny....not to mention making it over to Waterfall a couple times.</description>

Here’s the year-over-year for the crew:&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Was thinking about catching powder flu on wed, but the snow didn’t pan out.  Instead, there was a blast wednesday afternoon, so I headed up then.  Got 6” wednesday night...and had a great ditch day thursday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saturday and sunday only had dustings...but still, they kept eagle and parsenn and the ridge open for closing weekend, so I can’t complain.  Charts below...didn’t stick around for the C-Lift festivities on sunday...not enough energy.  :)</description>

Alli was good with me going solo...I was tracking a storm supposed to come in on Saturday night.  Spent saturday in spring conditions; met up with Matthias and did some more slushy bumps.  Sunday didn’t disappoint...woke up to 10”!!!  Hit MJ early, got in line at 8:20, and snagged 10th chair going up.  </description>

The weather didn’t disappoint:  I woke up to 4” of snow on the ground.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Started with some Belle laps...the top was completely socked in, but they still had the Cirque open.  Waited for the weather to clear, then decided to hike it.  Just got to the point where you start hiking (rather than gliding), and got a page from Matthias.  Met up with him on Eagle Wind, and we went and did Destiny and Waterfall...better snow than last weekend, and still really fun!</description>

Definitely spring conditions...icy mornings and slushy afternoons, so we got a late start.  Brought out both the new Rocker2’s and the S7s...but only used the S7s.  Started with a couple warm-up laps  under the C-lift, including Gunter doing Hole-in-the-Wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ended up hiking the cirque *twice* today...once to pick up the west headwall, and once over on Destiny, where we continued through to waterfall.  Cool stuff back there...but a little slushy.  Can’t wait to try it sometime when there’s less-baked snow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also nabbed Belle and Brian’s Run.   Good stuff...but yes, I’m sore!!!</description>

Alli had her dress, Max got an f-bag with a beard, and Gunter wore an f-bag outta the 80s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunter and I ran off when they hit lunch...and the Chutes were open!  I called Max, and we did a few laps in there.</description>

Hit multiple laps through Belle, and did the Cirque hike again...this time hitting destiny.  For those wondering which chute is where, here’s a guide:</description>

We had an additional 5” on top of yesterday’s goodness making the conditions pretty good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Went straight for the top in hopes of the cirque, but when we got there, Pano wasn’t open.  The chutes were, so we headed there...did “no name” first.  Pretty steep, definitely outta my comfort zone, but Max gave me some great tips (and yes, he totally ripped the **** outta it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next lap:  Upper Tophers, from the Trestle side.  We went a little further than my entrance from a couple years ago...while still steep, with that snow, it was a blast.  Next lap:  more chutes.  Max did Jeff’s...but it was a little too narrow for me (not *quite* enough snow) so I did no name again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pano was open, so we headed for the top.  Still no cirque, so we did Belle...and the conditions were *great* in there.  Vid below...had cams on both me and max.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lunch after that...good run through the west-side columbine trees, more tophers, more chutes (including baldy...the steepest/scariest thing I think I’ve skied).  Good stuff!!!</description>

I decided to forgo the bus, and drive up separately.  Chris and Ken both wanted to see some of my favorite trees...so I mostly played tour guide all day.  Did laps through upper switchyard and Belle to start off, then played a little under Eagle Wind.  At lunch, Ken, Richard and I decided to hike the cirque...ended up getting a snowmobile ride most of the way there (yay!  Gotta do that more often...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After lunch was Pine Cliffs, Weather Station, and Runaway...but that side’s snow wasn’t as good as the north facing stuff up top.  Still, good day...vid below.</description>

Even better back there this week...soooooo much better than last season.  Vid below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the afternoon, the freestyle devo program had a “ski with the coach” event...parents were invited to come ski with the class to see what kinds of things they were working on.  Alli dressed up as Jane...Dave was *way* impressed.  Started off with the Do-or-die trees, had them huck some smaller cliffs, and did Eagle and then Balsh.  VERY cool to see what they do (although Alli said she could have done without seeing them huck...) a really fun day!!!</description>

Max had comp#2 on saturday, but he and mom went back that night...so I had a full day of “wear Glenn out”.  :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They were supposed to get dumped on, but turns out they only got a couple inches.  Still, the trees were pretty good.  Belle was rocky up at the top, and the powder chute was a minefield (yes, had to fix one core shot...)  The trees were great though...could find stashes of deep pow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They also opened up the far-side of the cliff on Black Coal, giving access to Left Hand.  Good stuff in there.  No vids, but graphs below:</description>

This year, the snow wasn’t as good, but still got 3 days of good skiing in.  They had more of the Greeley area open...Gunter, Max and I explored over there.  Alta is much more about steeps, and not so much about bumps....I’m glad that I had that lesson with Tom that showed me how to get over my edges!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One highlight:  I saw Chuck Mumford (from GNAR), and gave him the pro call-out! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vid below...</description>

Alli met up with Caitlin, Miles, and Carolyn on Saturday, and convinced them to stay Saturday night.  Gunter convinced Michelle to come out Sunday...so we had a sizeable crew on the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Got some film of Max doing Pony, and showed ‘em around the sleepy trees and Eagle.  Max’s gloves were cold, so swapped out with Mom over at Pioneer, where after a lunch break, convinced him to get going again.  Met up with Matthias and Ray over there...did a couple laps before Mom and Max did a lunch break.  Gunter, Michelle, and I then finished out the day...</description>

On thursday, they did directed skiing at eagle wind for a little bit, and opened it in earnest friday.  Needless to say, that’s the first place I headed....‘twas still closed when I got to the top after dropping off Max, so I did a lap through the bowl.  Decent snow, but I snagged something and popped a ski off...which decided to go about another 50’ downhill.  Did a tele impression to go get it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Max’s group was a little slower, but they hit the traverse right as they were opening it....they got first tracks.  They were stoked.  :)  I hit it on my second lap...they had open all the way over to the cliff at black coal...and you could scoot under that.  Good snow in there...and got karma points for helping a couple folks...including one gentleman wigging out ‘cause he couldn’t find his ski.  (Don’t worry, I’ll stay with you...)</description>

Alli almost got the Mayor to judge, but instead, he decided to enter it himself.    Alli and Caitlin both dressed up, and they convinced Miles and James to be their “Miners”.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I mostly “drilled” for the day...that pole-drag thing that Tom showed me Wednesday works wonders.  I *think* I’m getting faster....and more confident. :)</description>

Firm conditions today; ended up in Tom’s group (the good news) with the old-farts (bad news).  Meant for much more talking and much less skiing, as evidenced by the charts above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Got a couple good tips out of it this time.  Tom really wanted us to stay over our skis, and not push the outside ski (and lean uphill in the process).  Started with the “lead with the inside ski” tip...more of a reminder for me, but I’ve noticed I’m doing the outside lead.  The one that *really* opened it up for me was the two pole drag:  ski with both poles dragging the snow.  This forces you to lower the downhill hand/shoulder (although I need to make sure I don’t let it get behind me), and also torques the lower body into a counter-balance position.  That was my main thing to work on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He also wants me to finish my turns...I’m starting the next bump too soon.  Now, just more practice...  </description>

It was warm, so Alli wore the dress and handed out stickers.  Unfortunately, the helmet cam wasn’t behaving, so no shots from the AM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They took off early; met up with Matthias over at pioneer.  Did a bunch of bumps; Alli was a hit from the folks on the chair.  Did have some shots that turned out from that (although the color is washed out)...clips below.</description>

Got 6” of snow friday; tried out the Graphite Zoom.  Note to self:  not a good wax for uber-cold.  Did the CH4 on Sunday....while it’s still not good, it’s *MUCH* better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Max had freestyle comp #1; he’s now in J5s, so significantly more competition (some of those boys were throwing 360s off the jump).  He still keeps looking better and better.  He’d go and do a practice run or two, come in and warm up, then head back out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vid below...</description>

Got early tracks...the trees under the lift were good, but you couldn’t turn or you’d stop.  The far side of the bowl was pretty good; did some laps through there before meeting up with Gunter and Michelle.  We did a lap through the switchyard trees before heading over to Vasquez.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best snow, though, was under pine cliffs.  Did an unintentional 3:57 game (Iron Horse), along with one last run with Gunter through there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun vid below of us playing around.  :)</description>

Alli, Max, Gunter and I met up with them over at Jane, and played around in the morning.  We played around a little in the new snow (3”), but they quickly decided that they needed a bloody mary break.  Gunter and Max and I then headed to hit the buckaroo trees...did a couple laps there.  Max then decided he wanted to be social, so Gunter and I went exploring.  We did some of the other trees under Pioneer, including hitting the stagecoach trees.  No one had gone that side, so we got some pretty good pow...but that also meant we needed to plow our own path on lower egress.  Did a few laps through there, then hit the lower switchyard trees.  Also good.  Ended the day on Living room...good stuff in there too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much better coverage this year than last year...they’ve got all of pioneer, most of the zephyr (just not Brian’s), and most of C-lift open (no brakeman, coupler, runaway, or the chutes, but the rest is open.  I’ve yet to explore trestle).  Pano and Eagle are still closed, and they only recently opened prospector up.  Yeah, weird...that usually opens much earlier.  </description>

They just opened pioneer yesterday, so even though there hasn’t been snow for a little while, I still brought out the S7s, as I figured the Buckaroo trees would be glorious.  I was right.  :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alli brought out the downhills...I had forgotten how much faster she was on those.  Got some great shots of her turns in the vid below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We did meet up with Max for lunch.  He was very excited, as they got first tracks down Short Haul, and hucked some of the rocks.  Dangerous!!!</description>

The deck didn’t indicate that much, but still, I grabbed the S7s and went out early with Max.  Got on the hill...I think they under-reported, and it snowed pretty much all day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We started off over on Jane and then headed over to Zephyr....they said they were gonna open Mulligan and Little Pierre today.  We did a lift ride up, and they both looked great...but the rope hadn’t dropped.  Ski patrol said “about another 15 min”, so we waited around.  Unfortunately, a huge crowd formed, and Max got cold, so he went in to warm up while I did a lap.  He wasn’t into doing the run, so I did it solo...and found goob after goob strewn across the run looking for their skis.  Heh.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mom came and got Max around lunch, and I did loads of laps through the HiLo trees, and by that time, Mulligan had turned into some decent moguls.  Still some nasties sticking out, but not as bad as last year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

They had Jane Trail, Narrow Gauge, the bottom of sterling and spike, and a few runs under Hi-Lo.  Alli went up and made an appearance with the Mayor...whilst the WP page doesn’t acknowledge her existence, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skyhidailynews.com/article/20121213/COLUMNISTS/121219975/1079&amp;parentprofile=1067&quot;&gt;Sky-High Daily News&lt;/a&gt; does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made it out on saturday...Alli was feeling a little under-the-weather, and max had coaching.  Jane was a little sketchy, but the Hi-Lo trees had promise.  I’m gonna have to make it back out tomorrow with S7s.  :)  They were running the olympia, so hope burns eternal that they hit the bottom of those runs.  Jabberwocky was pretty good...smaller bumps, but not too many nasties.  Bash, Balsh, and the Jane blacks were all evil.  Charts: &lt;br/&gt;</description>

Alli had a work party, so Max and I drove up early on friday.  The pass was slick...turns out we got 7” of bonus phresheez on friday night.  Mom drove up late that evening, and we had a decent powder day on Saturday, even though all Winter Park still has open is Cranmer, Sale, and the Discovery Park stuff.  It was *very* crowded, but it *did* give me the chance to break out my S7s.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Got 7” on Saturday Night, and Sunday was *COLD*...single digit highs.  Mom &amp;amp; Max decided to stay in, but I put the CH4 on the S7s and went out to get another morning worth of powder.   I’m not in mid-season shape, so I quit around lunchtime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the charts from Sat &amp;amp; Sun.</description>

Still no new snow, but Winter Park finally opened Cranmer on friday.  Note that with Gunter in town, the possibility of chocolate cake sandwiches comes into the picture...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saturday was Max’s first day of Freestyle Devo.  Dave Michel is is coach...they did some basic stuff, and started learning rails.  Very cool...Max was teaching me &amp;amp; Gunter on Sunday (and I’m still not ready for rails...my balance &amp;amp; confidence ain’t there yet.)  Max is getting it though. :)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunday, Max tried to teach Gunter and me the rail stuff he learned yesterday.  While I’m hopeless, Gunter did okay.  A couple pics:</description>

We headed up to Fraser friday during the day...just not good enough conditions to really get excited about skiing.  Max and Mom were iffy today, so I did a copper trip...they opened Windsong under the timberline yesterday...that was pretty good (got a couple 50 MPH runs in before it got too crowded).  Also had one green under the flyer open...not bad.  For the Eagle, in addition to Main Vein, they opened Bittersweet.  A little slick in spots, but good pitch.  You could also cut over to Super Bee via skid row...although they’re still doing the national team thing there, they did allow skiers on Copperopollis.  Did some runs through there and Ptarmigan.  They’re blowing snow on Andy’s Encore, and the Blacks under Excellerator look close.  Just need a dump...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winter Park still only has Sale, Parkway, and Porcupine open.  The webcams show ‘em blowing snow on Cranmer...note that last year at this time, they had Cranmer, Upper Hughes, and upper Oly open.  Not so this year.  :(</description>

Looked grim (just Porcupine &amp;amp; Parkway), but they opened Sale as well.  Max’s mission:  make a snow report for Gunter. </description>

They’ve got super-bee and copperopolis also open, but race only.  Headed up with Max today...they were supposed to get a bunch of snow.  While they got some, it wasn’t an epic dump.  Still, better than nothing...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...oh, and Max loves his new skis...K2 Juvy 139s.</description>
