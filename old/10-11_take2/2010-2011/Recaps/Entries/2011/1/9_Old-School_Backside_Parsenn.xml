    <richText>Some fresh (3" overnight, snowing all day), so I brought out the s7s.&#xA0; I *LOVE* those skis!!!.&#xA0; Eagle Wind wasn't running, but the trails were open, so I did the old-school 3-lifts-to-backside-parsenn.&#xA0; GREAT snow back there, and no people!!!&#xA0; And, found another hut down near black coal.&#xD;Bella was also open (but not advertised...), so I *had* to go do that.&#xA0; Decent coverage, but there were a few rocks under all that Pow. </richText>
