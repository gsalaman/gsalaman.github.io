    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Gunter came out again this weekend, and we got *another* shot of snow (yay!)  Alli met up with Caitlin, Miles, and Carolyn on Saturday, and convinced them to stay Saturday night.  Gunter convinced Michelle to come out Sunday...so we had a sizeable crew on the hill.&#xD;&#xD;Got some film of Max doing Pony, and showed &#x2018;em around the sleepy trees and Eagle.  Max&#x2019;s gloves were cold, so swapped out with Mom over at Pioneer, where after a lunch break, convinced him to get going again.  Met up with Matthias and Ray over there...did a couple laps before Mom and Max did a lunch break.  Gunter, Michelle, and I then finished out the day...&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
