    <richText>&lt;b&gt;No real snow to speak of since that storm on the 10th.  We headed up to Fraser friday during the day...just not good enough conditions to really get excited about skiing.  Max and Mom were iffy today, so I did a copper trip...they opened Windsong under the timberline yesterday...that was pretty good (got a couple 50 MPH runs in before it got too crowded).  Also had one green under the flyer open...not bad.  For the Eagle, in addition to Main Vein, they opened Bittersweet.  A little slick in spots, but good pitch.  You could also cut over to Super Bee via skid row...although they&#x2019;re still doing the national team thing there, they did allow skiers on Copperopollis.  Did some runs through there and Ptarmigan.  They&#x2019;re blowing snow on Andy&#x2019;s Encore, and the Blacks under Excellerator look close.  Just need a dump...&#xD;&#xD;Winter Park still only has Sale, Parkway, and Porcupine open.  The webcams show &#x2018;em blowing snow on Cranmer...note that last year at this time, they had Cranmer, Upper Hughes, and upper Oly open.  Not so this year.  :(&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
