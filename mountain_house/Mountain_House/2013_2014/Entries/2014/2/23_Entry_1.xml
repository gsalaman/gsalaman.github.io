    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Max had a bday party on sunday, so he and mom headed back saturday night.  Originally, the forcasts had called for 3ish inches, but as of saturday, it wasn&#x2019;t looking good.  Enter sunday morning:  7&#x201D; at WP!!!  Woo hoo!&#xD;&#xD;Day started off pretty typical...no pano or eagle because of winds.  Did Jane laps through the Columbine tress, Harolds+Weather Station, and Tophers until Eagle opened up.  Left hand was glorious...fresh tracks pretty much on demand.  Kept peeking over until they opened up pano...then it was time for Belle.  &lt;/b&gt;</richText>
