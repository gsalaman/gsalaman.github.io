    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Between Thanksgiving and Sunday, we didn&#x2019;t get any flakes.  Saturday was day 2 of Devo Travel Team for Max with Coach Scott...Alli stayed home, and I went and worked on my moguls.  They had C-lift and Sunnyside open...under C-lift was sketchy (Sleeper, Little Ten, Freeriders, and Phantom).  Same for Sunnyside (Bluebell, Roundhouse, and Edelweiss).  Got some good work in though...charts below.  Oh, and the perfect wax test:  see if you can make it from Super Gauge, down past Olympia and uphill to the top of Cheshire/Jabber without skating.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
