    <richText>12" saturday during the day, another 12" overnight.&#xA0; Alli and Max decided to hang out with Kate and the inlaws...Gunter and I headed up just as soon as they opened little cottonwood.&#xA0; EVIL traffic...finally hit the slopes around noonish.&#xD;The wildcat area (right side) was epic!&#xA0; Actually, the whole mountain was epic...did a bunch of runs in there, and WOW do those S7s rock!!!&#xA0; We did stuff off of Collins, and then headed over to Supreme, where we ended up doing some *super* steep stuff.&#xA0; My favorite:&#xA0; looking at a rope suspended in air over a cliffy/chute area, we joked "hey, that does no good"...but realized that it was a warning to not "huck the cliff".&#xA0; We tool around, look up, and there is that rope right above us!&#xA0;&#xD;</richText>
