<title>Winter Park 2008-2009 Season</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Winter Park 2008-2009 Season</h1>
<p>If it's winter, it means we're gonna be up in Winter park. This season was a 
new record for me (42 days) and Max (30 days).&nbsp; Alli managed 30; she didn't 
get up during the week as much as she has in seasons past.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once again, the season started out a little sketchy.&nbsp; Not a lot of snow, 
meaning that they opened with just Parkway and Larry Sale.&nbsp; Good news for 
Max:&nbsp; his favorite lift is open:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pommel.jpg" width="1024" height="379"></p>
<p>Note he's doing pretty good already....not a bad first day.</p>
<hr>
<p>We managed to convince Gunter to come out early season.&nbsp; (and a lot more 
that that...you'll see)&nbsp; This is from early december.&nbsp; Still not that 
much open, but they did have some bumps on Norwegian.&nbsp; Get down to the 
bottom, and it's Max's turn to pull Gunter!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_tow_gunter.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Note the bend in the poles...that will be very important later.&nbsp; </p>
<hr>
<p>And now, we hit the holiday break, and: (dum dum dummmmm...)&nbsp; &quot;The 12 
Days of Gunter!&quot;</p>
<p>Standard Operating Procedure:&nbsp; Bring your lunch.&nbsp; Here's Max taking 
a quick snack break on Butch's Breezeway.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_lunch.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_alli_discovery.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>&quot;Hi Max!!!!&quot;</p>
<p>A game for this season:&nbsp; ski in between Gunter's legs.&nbsp; No hospital 
trips yet....</p>
<hr>
<p>A couple lift pix:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="lift1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="lift2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<hr>
<p>Gunter introduces Max to a new game...throwing your poles off the lift!&nbsp;
</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pole1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Max, of course, races down to help...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pole2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>(note the bend is getting a little bigger now...)</p>
<hr>
<p>With the new Cabriolet lift, Winter Park *really* messed up their parking.&nbsp; 
Last year, if you parked in the Vintage lot, you got on the bus, and it dropped 
ya right by the ticket window.&nbsp; This year:&nbsp; you get on the Cabriolet, 
and have to walk through their new village (hmmmm....wonder why?), past the 
lifts to get to the middle.&nbsp; Alli's favorite quote:&nbsp; &quot;If you brought 
your girlfriend here to teach her to ski, she'd be done before you hit the 
lift&quot;.&nbsp; After xmas, they started providing little wagons, but they didn't 
do a good job making sure they were available.&nbsp; They also ran a kids 
shuttle; we took advantage of that a couple time.&nbsp; But, the first parking 
choice was still&nbsp; Jane...but that fills up fast, and doesn't really work if 
you either have beginners or someone needing lessons.&nbsp; So, we found the 
old-town lots.&nbsp; Our fav:&nbsp; the Bus Barn.&nbsp; You'd be first on the 
bus, and we could get parking there as late as 10:30ish on busy days.&nbsp; 
Bonus:&nbsp; the bus drops where the OLD busses dropped ya.&nbsp; These are from 
a particularly rowdy ride (rowdy crowd right in front of us)...we were having a 
lot of fun!!!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="bus1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="bus2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<hr>
<p>Max had a *bunch* of firsts this year.&nbsp; This is from his first time down 
Jane, 12/30/08.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_jane.jpg" width="576" height="768"></p>
<p>This was one of *many* times I made him cry this year.&nbsp; But, he was 
doing great...he just didn't want his picture taken.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_jane2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<hr>
<p>Another moment from the 12 days of Gunter.&nbsp; We meet up with Rod, 
Michelle, Amy, and Ken.&nbsp; Max digs the bumps at the bottom of Cranmer, so he 
convinces everyone to go.&nbsp; Ken races down...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="cranmer1.jpg" width="1064" height="798"></p>
<p>Gets up, and continues...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="cranmer2.jpg" width="1064" height="798"></p>
<p>Away they go!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="cranmer3.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<hr>
<p>Later that same day, riding up the Pioneer Express.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="tired_lift.jpg" width="1064" height="798"></p>
<p>He's soooooooo tired, he's just cuddling with mom.</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, some slopes, and some songs:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="phantom_bridge.jpg" width="1064" height="836"></p>
<p>&quot;Phantom Bridge is calling Glenn, calling Glenn, calling Glenn...&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="iron_horse.jpg" width="798" height="1064"></p>
<p>&quot;I love Iron Horse!&nbsp; Da dah da dah da dah dah...ski with me!&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="outhouse.jpg" width="873" height="768"></p>
<p>&quot;Outhouse......in the middle of the day&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Did the &quot;Searcher Ski Day&quot; in January.&nbsp; Got everyone warm, then dragged 
Tom and Kurt over to Eagle Wind...my new favorite area.&nbsp; (Well, for a 
while...)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="tom.jpg" width="1064" height="798"></p>
<p>Tom almost takes out a baby tree.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="thunderbird_search.jpg" width="1064" height="798"></p>
<p>Look!!! Powder!!!&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="tom_kurt.jpg" width="1064" height="798"></p>
<p>...and yeah, we broke Kurt.</p>
<hr>
<p>Max did the Minnows class this year.&nbsp; Each session was 3 Saturdays with 
the same group of kids and the same instructor.&nbsp; This year, he started on 
level 4 with Tony, with a group of kids that, well, see for yourself:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="team_red.jpg" width="1050" height="900"></p>
<p>Tony said it was easy to keep the class together.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; After the 
first 3 weeks, pretty much the whole class moved up to Level 5 (starting with 
poles), and Tony stayed their instructor.&nbsp; At the end of the session, Tony 
had 'em doing Wildwood Glade, Engledive, and Hughes.</p>
<hr>
<p>This was my best year yet for lessons.&nbsp; I did two of the &quot;Bump Jams&quot;...a 
full day of intense bumps.&nbsp; You start out at the top of the Jane center, 
and you put yourself in Level 1 (blue bumps), Level 2 (Blue-Black, can link 
10-15 turns), or Level 3 (Black bumps, stop once or twice on a run).&nbsp; They 
then further break ya up into groups.&nbsp; Session 1 was with &quot;Parti Pam&quot;, and 
it was a class size of 4.&nbsp; That rocked!&nbsp; Got a lot of great tips 
(backwards skiing, balance, Functional Ankle Tension, how to ditch speed, etc).&nbsp; 
After doing that, I ended up taking Bob and Simon down Boiler:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="boiler.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Ahhhh...a good day.&nbsp; </p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="max_chats.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Here's Max, Simon, and Catherine going up the Eskimo. Note the nice lady on 
Max's right...he's chatting her up.</p>
<p>(no, he didn't score)</p>
<p>(that time)</p><hr>
<p><img border="0" src="max_dad.jpg" width="576" height="768"></p>
<p>A typical Max and Dad pose...</p>
<hr>
<p>Gunter *loves* to getcha on things that are just above your ability.&nbsp; 
After the Bump Jam #1, my confidence was *way* too high.&nbsp; So he takes me on 
a hidden path to the &quot;super-secret bowl&quot; below the chutes.&nbsp; One wipe out 
later...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="secret_path1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>&quot;Why do I always follow him?!&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="secret_path2.jpg" width="576" height="768"></p>
<p>Okay, yeah, this is kinda cool...</p><hr>
<p><img border="0" src="groovinalli.jpg" width="428" height="604"></p>
<p>Groovin' Alli!!!</p>
<hr>
<p>Google Earth is a dangerous thing.&nbsp; I was playing around there, checking 
out the Eagle Wind Trails (looking for less-dense paths down), and I noticed the 
meadow:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="meadow_google_earth.jpg" width="1448" height="948"></p>
<p>Naturally, Gurnter and I *had* to find it.&nbsp; You can see it from the top 
of Eagle Wind.&nbsp; We've tried to hit it from that path from the top of the 
Pioneer, but that goes uphill, and is roped off. We finally hit it by going down 
Thunderbird, staying as far to the right (towards Switchyard) as possible.&nbsp; 
We crossed the traverse (the white line on the map) and finally worked our way 
down to the meadow.&nbsp; We tried it again from switchyard...while you can see 
that path to the opening, they've got it marked as &quot;closed&quot;.</p>
<p>So, the next weekend (which happened to be President's Day weekend), we 
dragged everyone else out there.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="meadow1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Note that Alli and Gunter are in their tele's, so they had to blaze their own 
path.&nbsp; I'm sticking to the existing path...it's *FLAT* in there.</p>
<p>And, if you've got all that powder, you may as well throw yourself into it.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="glenn_meadow.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_meadow1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="meadow2.jpg" width="1024" height="672"></p>
<p>Ahhhh....so peaceful, it's hard to believe it's in the middle of the resort.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="michelle_meadow.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>The missing picture:&nbsp; Gunter knocking Michelle over into the powder.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_meadow2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>And then, we all throw snow on Gunter.</p>
<p>(Note the rental Tele's.&nbsp; He rectified that situation later in the 
season.)</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="alli_thunderbird.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Alli on Thunderbird.</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="alli_powder1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Always pick a bright color jacket, to show really how deep the powder is!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="alli_powder2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>The only problem with powder in the trees...it's sometimes hard to get up!</p>
<hr>
<p>The general QC Ski day was cancelled, due to 2009 happening and all the 
teambuilding funding getting pulled.&nbsp; They still had an informal ski day, 
but I was in San Diego, so I couldn't make it.&nbsp; Ehren was gonna go, so we 
offered up to him to meet in Fraser friday night, and ski on Saturday.&nbsp; 
Turns out, he was the only QC-er to ski on friday.&nbsp; Bummer!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="ehren_outhouse.jpg" width="1024" height="963"></p>
<p>We made up for it on Saturday though...took him down some good bump runs 
(including this one), and introduced him to the Eagle Wind area, and lots o' the 
tree trails we've been doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mid-March...by now, Max has had all of his classes, and is doing pretty well!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_engledive1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>&quot;Come on Gunter!!!&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_bigfeet.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>&quot;Go ahead Max!&quot;</p>
<p>(Yes, it was a &quot;Big Feet&quot; day)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_engledive2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Zoom!&nbsp; Away he goes...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_bowl.jpg" width="1024" height="838"></p>
<p>Same day, from the bottom of Parsenn Bowl.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_trees1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Bouncing in and outta the trees on Engledive...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_trees2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Every once in a while, you just get stuck.</p>
<hr>
<p>My new favorite run:&nbsp; Belle Fourche</p>
<p><img border="0" src="glenn_belle1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>This is from 3/15, and the snow isn't even that great.&nbsp; (Although I 
thought so that day....)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="glenn_belle2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>(No, I'm not Tele-ing...just bad form.)</p>
<p>Later that day, we do the hike...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="glenn_cirque.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_cirque.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>(no, he's not pumped)</p>
<p>We came down the South Headwall.&nbsp; It's right over that ridge over the 
left hump before the cornice begins.&nbsp; Spent so much energy skiing it that I 
forgot to take pictures...but that's probably a good thing.</p>
<hr>
<p>As intro, I'm *not* going to say that since I did the Cirque, Alli felt it 
necessary...instead, I'll just say that she was looking for a suitable 
challenge.&nbsp; She did get much cooler pictures than I did...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="cirque.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>The view of the South and West Headwalls.&nbsp; This is where she *thought* 
she was gonna go down...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="alphabet_top.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>...and this is where they *really* went down.&nbsp; Alphabet Chute...doesn't 
really do it justice, as you can't see the drop...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="alphabet_gunter1.jpg" width="1024" height="741"></p>
<p>...but this one does!!!&nbsp; </p>
<p>(C'mon!&nbsp; One!&nbsp; Two!&nbsp; Three!&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; ....Okay, really 
this time...One!&nbsp; Two!....)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="alphabet_lunch.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Okay, then, this looks like a great spot for lunch!!!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="alphabet_alli1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="alphabet_alli2.jpg" width="1024" height="1204"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="alli_bottom.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Did she really just come down that?!?</p><hr>
<p><img border="0" src="max_gunter.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Spring break starts.&nbsp; Max is a *lot* more comfortable now, and note that 
Gunter's poles are bent a little more.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_powder1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>

<p>Hey, why'd I stop?</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_trees3.jpg" width="768" height="1024"></p>
<p>Getting more confident in the trees.&nbsp; He loves to fall in light powder!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="deck1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Mid-week.&nbsp; Now *this* is more like it! </p>
<p><img border="0" src="belle1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Belle Fourche, but the view is a little deceptive...it's a lot steeper than 
it looks.&nbsp; Note *exactly* one track preceding us.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_belle1.jpg" width="1024" height="880"></p>
<p>Second tracks!&nbsp; Note the bend in the poles now.&nbsp; Also note that 
this is probably the reason he got the new Phantoms...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_belle2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Or maybe this was...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_belle3.jpg" width="768" height="1024"></p>
<p>Note one ski still attached, one implanted nose first.&nbsp; Not sure how 
that happened...</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="max_powder2.jpg" width="768" height="1024"></p>
<p>April begins.&nbsp; Max does more powder above Edelweiss.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="left_hand.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>One of the paths through the trees at Left Hand.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gunter_belle4.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Gunter's first binding release on the new Phantoms.&nbsp; He's had to climb 
up about 15 feet to get to ski #1, and ski #2 is about 20 feet above that.&nbsp;
</p>
<hr>
<p>So we saw the path to the secret bowl up above a ways.&nbsp; Gunter found an 
easier (lower) path that wasn't as steep, if you cut left on Trestle just after 
the first bump field.&nbsp; Here's the view after you get through the trees:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="secret_bowl1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>

<p>This is looking north-eastish.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="secret_bowl2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>And, panning around to the right.&nbsp; Runaway is that furthest right run, 
which I still think is &quot;evil-steep&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<p>Easter...and the first year Max does the &quot;ski&quot; egg hunt.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="easter1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Ready to go!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="easter2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>The loot.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="easter3.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Let the trampling begin...</p>
<hr>
<p>Closing weekend, and we *finally* get a big dump.&nbsp; Alli, Max and I head 
up just after noon on friday, worried about the weather.&nbsp; Good thing we 
do...Floyd Hill was *NASTY*.&nbsp; The pass wasn't bad though...it's nice to 
have Alli's car back.&nbsp; We get up there at 4ish, and find shortly thereafter 
that the pass (and I70) has been closed.&nbsp; Well, that's good news for skiing 
tomorrow, but bad news as Gunter is flying in that evening!&nbsp; His flight 
gets delayed a couple times, but he does make it to Golden that evening.</p>
<p>Meanwhile...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dump1.jpg" width="576" height="768"></p>
<p>We start shoveling the front deck.&nbsp; Go the path on the right, wait 30 
min, an we've got another 6 inches.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="dump2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>The view out the back.</p>
<p>The next day.&nbsp; Max, where do you want to ski?&nbsp; &quot;Cheshire Cat!&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="cheshire_powder.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>The problem....he's never skied powder this deep.&nbsp; He kept falling, and 
crying, and had trouble getting up.&nbsp; A nice lady stopped and told him that 
he had to stay back, but after this run, he was done with powder.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; 
Fortunately for Dad, so was Mom...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gambler_powder.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Everyone else was headed to Jane, so I headed over to Vasquez Ridge.&nbsp; 
Gambler and Aces and Eights were glorious!&nbsp; Lots of powder over those 
moguls.&nbsp; This is the bottom of Gambler.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="gambler_powder2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>And, the view a little later in the day.</p>
<hr>
<p>Closing day with Max.&nbsp; The new game:&nbsp; take a picture of me when I 
fall!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_fall1.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Of course, he falls a lot more with that game.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="max_parsens.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Another one, from Parsen's bowl. </p>
<hr>
<p>Why are these two happy?</p>
<p><img border="0" src="glenn_gunter.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>They're on the C-lift at closing day, and they played a 3:55 game.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="top_of_c1.jpg" width="1024" height="500"></p>
<p>The party at the top of the C-lift.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="top_of_c2.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Note the snowballs flying.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="top_of_c3.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Getting ready to ski down.</p>
