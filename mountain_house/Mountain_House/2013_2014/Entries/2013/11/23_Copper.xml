    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Came up this weekend with Mom and Max.  Checked the reports first thing in the morning...although WP announced Jane is opening on next tuesday, the Zephyr still isn&#x2019;t running (just Sale and all the Discovery Park stuff).  Loveland has some of the blues off of Chair 2 (Firecut &amp; Drifter) and Chair 6 (Keno, Blackjack), but Copper has some of the stuff under Timberline *and* some of the blacks under Excellerator.  I convinced them to do the drive.  :)&#xD;&#xD;[and yes, the drive was a little evil.  almost 2 hrs, bad traffic, slippery conditions.  but it was worth it]&#xD;&#xD;Mom went over to timberline early...Max and I hit the blacks. REAL MOGULS!!!  Yay!!!  Had a blast...vid and stats below.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
