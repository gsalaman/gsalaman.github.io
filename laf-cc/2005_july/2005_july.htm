<h1>July 2005:&nbsp; San Diego &amp; Disneyland</h1>
<p>This July, Dad took Mom and Max out on one of his business trips to San 
Diego.&nbsp; While he slaved away in the office, they went to the Aquarium, 
Legoland, and the Beach.&nbsp; Finally, the weekend came and on Saturday, they 
all went out to Del Mar, where Max modeled his latest surfer gear.</p>

<p>Note that the newest beach accessory is a green plastic cup...used to store 
your sand.</p>
<hr>
<p>Then, on Sunday, they picked up a crazy hitchhiker, and headed to the 
happiest place on earth.&nbsp; (No, not Tijuana...)</p>

<p>Then, we played around in Toon-town.&nbsp; Mom got brave, and took him on 
Goofy's roller coaster....</p>
