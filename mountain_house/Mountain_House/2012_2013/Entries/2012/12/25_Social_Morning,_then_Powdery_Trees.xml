    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Caitlin came up in the morning with a couple friends.  Alli, Max, Gunter and I met up with them over at Jane, and played around in the morning.  We played around a little in the new snow (3&#x201D;), but they quickly decided that they needed a bloody mary break.  Gunter and Max and I then headed to hit the buckaroo trees...did a couple laps there.  Max then decided he wanted to be social, so Gunter and I went exploring.  We did some of the other trees under Pioneer, including hitting the stagecoach trees.  No one had gone that side, so we got some pretty good pow...but that also meant we needed to plow our own path on lower egress.  Did a few laps through there, then hit the lower switchyard trees.  Also good.  Ended the day on Living room...good stuff in there too.&#xD;&#xD;Much better coverage this year than last year...they&#x2019;ve got all of pioneer, most of the zephyr (just not Brian&#x2019;s), and most of C-lift open (no brakeman, coupler, runaway, or the chutes, but the rest is open.  I&#x2019;ve yet to explore trestle).  Pano and Eagle are still closed, and they only recently opened prospector up.  Yeah, weird...that usually opens much earlier.  &lt;/b&gt;</richText>
